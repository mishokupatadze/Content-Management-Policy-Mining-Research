Cuckold is a derivative of \"cuckooed\" as in the parasitic cuckoo bird that lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species and has them raise their young. To be cuckolded is to inadvertently raise the children born of your wife's unfaithfulness. Robert Baratheon was cuckolded by Cersei Lannister with the help of her brother. Get it now, you dumb assholes?\n\nA man isn't cuckolded because his female partner has an individual will or an opinion. Nor is it because he doesnt uphold some historically naive and archaic notion of \"traditional gender roles\". Nor is it because she is actively conspiring to supress some cartoonish masculine ideal while paradoxically being too stupid to walk amd chew gum at the same time.

If you forget, most people are ok with they\/them as defaults, which requires less effort than assuming he\/she. Using they\/them signifies that you're making an effort to be respectful, and you will certainly not be treated in a hostile way. I don't get why it's perceived to be so difficult to extend basic courtesy to people who don't feel comfortable with binary gender norms. You don't have to understand it, just don't be an asshole.\n\nGender is complicated for a lot of nonbinary folks; if you bothered to get to know them instead of constructing a bigoted strawman, you would know that it's ridiculous to think that anyone expects you to know without getting to know them. The entire point of being nonbinary is that gender isn't set in stone and there's so much variance as to how people express themselves or they could even be genderfluid - no one is asking you to read their minds. It's really baffling when you compare Reddit's strawman with reality.\n\nIf someone is hostile to you about the way you gender them, it's because you're an asshole who chooses to be disrespectful. Even if you use he\/she erroneously and you never met that person before, either a) the nonbinary person is *afraid* to state their preference with people they don't trust because it may invite bigoted behavior or b) they may correct you and they're not going to crucify you if you have never met them before because nonbinary people are well aware we live in a cisnormative world and there's a long way to go as far as education goes. That being said, you are making shit worse for nonbinary people by spreading misinformation about them with stupid memes. You are also an asshole if that person specifically requested you to use certain pronouns and you deem it too difficult to show them basic respect. \n\ntl;dr: Respect the person's wishes or default to they\/them if you are unsure.

MRM desperately graps around for problems that affect males while other groups have problems that affect their lives ubiquitously. \n\nMRM seems to become upset when historically suppressed groups become empowered - even by just a little. Being upset because you've seen attention drawn to the rights of women and minorities is a sad temper tantrum of immature, ignorant men. MRM--much like the \"All Lives Matter\" movement--trivializes important movements for groups who actually do need their rights expanded. \n\nMRM makes men look immature, ignorant, sexist, racist, and various other bigoted things. A MRM activist might counter saying that they aren't any of those things--that they support rights for *everyone* including men. But they fail to realize that their entire movement belittles movements that are actually fighting for needed rights. And so that makes it bigoted by its mere existence. \n\nMen's rights do not need to be fought for. We already have them.

But they don't see that the rise in false rape accusations is pretty much the same. Sensationalist news media will try to pinpoint your fears and confirm them for clicks and ad revenue. They are falling for the exact same fear-mongering while they preach about how enlightened they are for seeing through the lies of the media. This kind of media is driven to play off of the public's fears and thinking you're immune to it is downright naive. Especially now when we see half of the country brainwashed because Facebook data and metrics were leaked to a political organization designed to sway your opinions and confirm your biases. If somebody can try to sell you on your fears and tell you exactly what you want to hear, you're most likely going to fall for it. You should count yourself lucky if it hasn't happened to you yet and try to actually search for the truth in these things instead of immediately folding into confirmation bias.\n\nThis talk about \"punishing false rape accusers\" is also extremely dangerous. It's only going to create a [chilling effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chilling_effect) as actual rape victims will be too afraid to report their rapes. Rape is almost always a \"he said-she said\" situation and often comes down to hearsay. It's very difficult to obtain evidence of rape even if you do everything in your power to get it and do everything right. The natural reaction to being raped is to try to shut it out, try to pretend it didn't happen, and remove items or things that remind you of it - because it is an especially traumatic event. It's not something you can approach with your textbook STEM reasoning and assume that humans will behave exactly like the book says without anyone straying from the path at all.\n\nWhen a situation comes down to your word versus some else's how can you do anything to prove it? Especially when there will be punishments for failure to do so. The safest option for yourself quickly becomes: don't report it or you'll go to jail and find yourself in both a court of law and the court of public opinion. You'll be denigrated as a slut, told that you wanted it but you're just ashamed, that you're evil and vindictively trying to ruin the lives of these nice boys.

They honestly think the entire field is dedicated to killing all men, claiming there's a wage gap (and yes there is, you idiots), and ruining video games under the rule of Anita Sarkeesian, the most influential feminist in history. You can find similar misrepresentations about any non-STEM subject if you look around a little.\n\nThe thing is, most liberal arts fields are actually quite complex. I'm a former STEM major, and gender theory is right up there with my most difficult courses. Any field where there's ambiguity or nuance is automatically more challenging than one where it's just a matter of memorizing which equation to use when. (I know, that's an oversimplification of STEM - how do you like it?) But Redditors seem to lack the ability to deal with nuance or multiple possible meanings. So instead of trying to learn something and better themselves, they get mad and tear down a stupid caricature of the field they've failed to comprehend.\n\nAnd normally, it'd be OK to let them wallow in ignorance. Unfortunately, this leads to a refusal to understand race relations, oppression of women, LGBT issues, etc. Real people really suffer because too many would rather scoff at a strawman than try and understand 101-level ideas in the liberal arts.\n\nSo overall, Redditors are too dumb to understand the complexities of liberal arts, and should really just stick to their equations and coding.

LGBT+ people EXISTING is in and of itself a political statement. I see no better time than now to discuss the still rampant homophobia and transphobia in America. It won't be much longer until the nation shoves its collective head back into the sand and tries to fool itself into thinking it's a bastion of progress with its safe-to-appreciate LGBT figureheads in popular media and its recent legalization of gay marriage. Admittedly I've spent most of my time away from the Internet today to get away from the worst, but what I've seen - on both sides of the political spectrum - is people using this tragedy as an opportunity to advance their pet agendas (islamophobic rhetoric from the right, gun control from the left).\n\nMeanwhile the LGBT+ community mourns, is trying to support its members that are scared for their lives and cancelling plans to attend pride events, and is faced with a gruesome reminder that their acceptance isn't normalized or broad and violence could come against them at any moment for being themselves.

They're the only ones I've seen talking about how the attack took place at a LGBT+ nightclub frequented by black and Latinx LGBT+ people - with Trans talent headlining - *during Pride month*. They're the only ones I've seen talking about how fucked up it is the FDA still has a ban on gay men donating blood if they've had sex with a man in the past month in the day and age of fast HIV testing.

I'm so goddamn angry and tired of knowing this will play out the same as every mass shooting in America has - Gun control and islamophobic rhetoric will be swung everywhere, it'll eventually fade from the popular discussion, and no changes whatsoever will be made.

This is partially because they believe themselves to be Allah's chosen people, but this in turn is based on the fact that invaders have lost most of their wars in the Middle East: Russia and America both lost in Afghanistan, France lost in Algeria, and America lost in Iraq. Further military involvement is exactly what ISIS wants, and redditors are bloodthirsty enough to play into their hands.\n\nFurthermore, accepting refugees with open arms would strike a massive blow against ISIS' support. They've been telling their subjects that the West is their enemy, and that we hate Islam and all its practitioners.  Bombing those people just reinforces ISIS' twisted ideology and drives a wedge between us and the civilian population.

Every time the topic of \"SJW\" or \"tumblr\" comes up, or a video of a hot girl hits the top of \/r\/videos, \"rape culture\" somehow gets brung up by some TiA regular. Stop it. Not only are you helping rape to be \"just another issue\" and not the life-fucking experience it should be treated as, you're also mocking rape victims for getting reminded of the trauma they went through. Like, they keep saying \"rape is a srs issue and feminists are trivializing it by using triggers and advertising rape culture\", yet here you guys are using that exact culture to mock feminists! Is your need to make fun out of a movement you oppose really so strong you can't see the enormous hypocrisy in your actions? You're showing rape-victims the finger too! You clearly do not give a flying fuck about the people you're supposedly \"defending\" from the feminists, you're *mocking* them so you can get upvotes from other feminist hating people!\n\nSo why do they do this? Easy, karma. I don't think a lot of people understand this, but karma is more than just imaginary internet points to some people. Its validation. That a \"community\" somehow approves of what they say, so they can compensate for the sad and bitter lifestyle they have in real life. And because reddit mostly consists of edgy 15 year olds and neckbeards so bitter dark coffee becomes marshmallows in comparison, its much easier getting these \"validation points\" by mocking what they neckbeards mocking: Feminism, not being a cunt, \"freedom of speech\" which in reality is just \"freedom to say whatever you want without consequence\" and tumblr in general. And this is sadly where they lose touch with \"reality\" so to speak. They keep getting upvotes from the neckbeards by for example *mocking rape victims*, and because they have nothing else to get happiness from in their suburban life they get tricked into thinking that the neckbeards are right. They get fooled into thinking mocking feminism and mocking tumblr is the right thing to do because their brain have associated those internet points with actual \"euphoria\", and we have a tendency to \"follow our emotions\". Another thing they see is that our comments, the \"SJWs\" and the \"please stop being mean to eachother\" club are getting downvoted by the same neckbeards that upvotes themselves. This just deludes them even more, and gives them a negative impression of everything that is against their so called \"belief\". After all they do base their selfworth on these points, a group of people sending out a message in the negative would awake a negative bias in the subject.\n\n Now, if they are just a easily impressionable teenager they will grow out of it. They will get a girlfriend, join an university and just kind of slip out of the \"anti tumblr\/feminism\/whatever* club when they start college and actually begins forming relationships. And we never really her about those people again so it's hard to see just how many people convert. Sadly based on the fact that \"SJWs\" and anti-fph people are STILL getting downvoted I got to say that they are the minority. I guess some of them begins hanging around here and other \"non neckbeard\" subreddits but most people just seemingly grow up and disappear.\n\nAnd then we got the rest. Those who sticks their fedoras so far up their ass their veins are filled with Doritos. These are the ones who controls the votes.

We start at regular TiA poster, move up to TiA regular, then we slowly move up to CringeAnarchy and justneckbeardthings. Now this is usually where most people dwell if they don't grow up, but if they are truly bitter they go deeper. Here we find FPHers and STEM circlejerk contributors. Now the thing is that these people are widely disagreed upon, yet they somehow keep finding themselves in mod positions at various big subs.

There's a lot of anti-Asian sentiment in general that's pretty broadly acceptable in America (and Europe, etc.) so long as you keep it low-key, but Sinophobia especially is on the rise, it's a growing target of so-called \"economic anxiety.\" \n\nPeople drop a smokescreen of claiming they're critical of the Chinese government, or if they're a little more transparent, Chinese \"culture.\" When you look at the exact Sinophobic claims however it usually has nothing to do with the government and the claims are pretty much pure moral statements about the Chinese.

In a patriarchy where women are regularly belittled and undervalued, men with traits that are coded as feminine will also face some version of that.\n\nIf we lived in a more equal and feminist culture, beauty standards would be much less rigid because there would be less pressure for men to be masculine and women to be feminine, and gendered physical traits could be attractive no matter the gender of the person who has those traits.","\"I remember when I was growing up...\"\n\n\"Back in the 90s...\"\n\n\"People weren't such...\"\n\nJust stop.\n\nBeing sensitive to others isn't a matter of hopping on a trend.

If, for instance, you spent all day long hanging out with a street gang, started speaking like other members of the gang, started wearing the same clothes as the gang--wouldn't you *expect* that other people are going to assume you're in a street gang, even if you're not? Would you not *expect* to be treated like a potentially dangerous criminal? At some point, wouldn't you start to think that maybe being treated like a gangster isn't a lot of fun and perhaps getting away from the gang would be a good idea? And, unless they are especially thoughtful and considerate gangsters, wouldn't the gang eventually expect you to commit yourself and join up for real?\n\nI guess the bottom line is that expecting people to *not* see you as racist and sexist and homophobic--you know, all of those things--is completely pointless if you are a Trump supporter.

One of the jokes in the episode is that they are such horny bastards that this isn't something they mind happening.  At least, someone could make that argument to attempt to counter mine.  That being said, Reddit has expressed a total lack of self-reflection when it comes to this episode in particular and the subject matter when presented comedically in general.  It betrays a certain apathy that the majority of Reddit wants to enjoy what they enjoy without sociological criticism of it.","With all the posts saying shit like \"DAE think racism against white people exists\", that sub should just be renamed \/r\/Posireddit.","\"Most minorities are lazy and stupid. They don't even *try* to improve their lives. But Asians are different. See how they actually care about education, and actively persue academia. Why can't blacks and Hispanics be like that?\"\n\n\"Look at how the Jews persue education so desperately and help each other persue academia! It's all part of their conspiracy to stay in power and keep goyim down! Why can't you sheep see that?\"\n\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd think the only reason Reddit treats Asians and Jews differently is because of their creepy fetishization of Asian women.\n\nOh wait, I do know better and that is the reason.","One thing that I dislike about reddit is that by science they literally only mean space travel and their views on actual space exploration isn't realistic or grounded in reality at all but based on nostalgic sci fi movies\/tv shows.

His campaign was based on slander and empty promises. \n\nGod bless this shitty ass country. ","First of all I'm not dismissing hardcore racism or saying it's acceptable or anything like that. It just seems so much more surprising to me. My understanding from the real world is that most people I know are either like serious \"obummer needs to go back Africa!!\" intense racists, or pretty much not racist. At least not maliciously racist, they may be unaware of their privilege, but it's mostly a racism of ignorance not hatred.\n\nWords like \"Swedish\" or \"Irish\" have two definitions: nationality and ethnicity. You could have a black guy who's an Irish citizen, and that guy is Irish, or a guy in Germany with Irish heritage, and that guy is Irish. Maybe the people I know are in the minority, but in my mind and in my real world experiences, those words almost always refer to the nationality. If I'm told someone is Swedish and they turn out to be Asian, I don't at all have a reaction of \"but I thought you said Swedish?\" It's a nationality first and I guess *technically* this guy is ethnically Chinese or Malay or whatever but mainly I would say he's Swedish.\n\nReddit doesn't seem to think that way. I've seen a number of stories about \"Swedish person does ABC\" or \"German person does XYZ\" and all the comments are deriding the article for calling them Swedish or German when clearly they're Islamic and either first or second generation immigrants. People will talk about PC culture or PC gone mad or whatever. This is something that I wouldn't even *begin* to say is political correctness, like it just wouldn't ever cross my mind. If you're a Swedish national, you're Swedish.\n\nAnother thing is Reddit's view on race mixing*. Again, I don't mean the \/r\/European \"death to n-lovers\" crap, I mean like mainstream Reddit views. It seems that the prevailing attitude is that race mixing is a problem. Like someone will call someone out for having a beef with race mixing, and then they will respond one of two ways:\n\n1) \"You wouldn't want a bunch of Asian people in an African country would you? PC makes you think it's bad to want white people to have their own land, but every other race gets its own land.\" Uhhh I totally wouldn't care?? I mean, I don't want a bunch of Asians like rounded up against their will and forced into Africa, but if a lot of them want to move there let them do it. Sometimes they add \"until black people are a minority in Africa\" to that caveat, which again, I don't see the problem. If a certain race goes above or below 50% of the population in some place, that's just a weird coincidence to me, not something I would consider a problem.\n\n2) \"Well the choices are either that white people stick with white people, or all races interbreed and we no longer have races.\" So? I don't want some kind of centralized plan for races of people, just do what you want. If a white guy wants to be with a black girl and she wants to be with him, let it happen, good for them. Same if he wants to be with a consenting white girl. Just let people do what they want, who cares about \"the future of the white race.\"\n\n**So I guess my question is this: am I this out of touch?** Is this just some weird Reddit idiosyncrasy where everyone cares about the white race like it's a business that needs to turn a profit or go under, or is this normal? I swear I'm not trying to be PC about it, PC just wouldn't even cross my mind as a relevant issue here. Sorry for the long winded post\n\n*after rereading this I just want to point out I'm not at all someone who would use \"race mixing\" as a serious term, like it's not something I would ever have a problem with or even think needs a term to describe it, it's just a thing that happens. But it was relevant in this post so that's why it appears so much here","It's inevitable in every fucking thread discussing sexual assault. \n\n\"What, do you expect us to draw up a whole contract beforehand?\"\n\n\"I have to stop and ask before *everything* I do? That's not sexy.\"\n\n**If a simple check-in to make sure your partner feels good is enough to ruin the mood, you didn't set it up properly in the first place.**\n\nSo many dudes on reddit deliberately misinterpret asking consent as literally having to ask \"Do you consent to having my penis inside you?\" before every thrust. And then use the un-sexiness of that to wave off the whole concept.\n\nWork it into your dirty talk! State what you want to do in a sexy way and let your partner either respond in kind or refuse. Just because the men in porn are silent beyond the occasional grunt doesn't mean you've gotta be. If you're not talking you're missing out on a great form of foreplay and extra stimulation. And, you know, potentially hurting someone if you're not paying attention. Which should be more important than \"\"the mood\"\" to anyone with a shred of decency.\n\nDon't trust your ability to sound sexy? You don't have to be formal to check in with your partner either.

Let's moan about women working and having jobs outside of the home but vote for policy makers that give takes breaks to 2 income house hold while screwing over single income house hold because single mothers need to be punished. It's striking that a living wage was campaigned by Clinton and Bernie but was ignored. Republicans\/conservatives will never approve of living wage policy but yet they're revered for some reason.  It really seems counter productive.  \n\nEdit: I don't think that all conservatives are bad. Some like Rand Paul actually make sense on occasion. You have have 9.7 trillion dollars in new debt and corporate welfare while lowering goverment revenue by reducing taxes substantially. It's also important to understand that when you lower revenue and increase debut the risk of defaulting is real. Debt accumulates faster than income and we have a president who went bankedrupt 6 times.

For many years his favorite hobby has involved getting involved with beauty pageants, the younger the better to him, and bragging about how much access he has to creeping on the girls there. I don't even have to get started on how much he's creeped on his own daughter over the years.\n\nHe certainly has no issue with child abuse, such as when he committed child abuse because one of his sons wouldn't wear a suit and tie for an event that did not require it. Presumably, like front-page Redditeurs like to say, he got his ass kicked as a kid and he turned out fine.\n\nHe certainly has no issue with sexual assault, being a perpetrator himself, such as when he tore the hair off of his ex-wife's head and violently violated her because he didn't like how his scalp surgery went. Like the brave Reddit rape-apologists would have it, he has heroically evaded ever paying a legal price for that and has sent his volunteer internet hate squads to harass victims into silence, forcing them to withdraw their cases.\n\nHe'll say whatever the winds favor to earn admiration and approval. He's farming real-life's Reddit Karma, so to speak.\n\nThis is a huge one: \"TELLING IT LIKE IT IS\".

You can disagree with many circlejerks, but if you do it in a well-written and contributing way, you can have a discussion. Not for any SJW type stuff though! If you ever mention safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, anything like that without 1) the necessary \"scare quotes\" and 2) disagreeing with the concept completely.\n\nWhat a BORING viewpoint redditors have.\n\nI think it could be kinda cool to discuss these issues. Don't just post memes (ever under any circumstance, but like, also in this case), actually discuss it. Don't massively downvote everyone who doesn't properly signal against \"safe spaces\" and talk about how much they hate them. Redditors will try to hear out both sides and have an actual discussion about pretty much any discussion so long as it isn't SJW-y. C'mon reddit, you can let your guard down for a minute, I promise a blue-haired fat woman won't reach through your computer screen and slap you.\n\nPlus, it's just disappointing. I like reading the tremendously downvoted crazy people comments, and it's always so disappointing to get to that huge like -60 comment and it's just someone with a totally reasonable but left-leaning position. Like there will be some discussion about race, and at like -4 and -8 you have a couple people saying we need segregation, -11 someone campaigning for David Duke, -20 someone saying we need to kill all black people, and then there's one comment at like -60. I always get to that one like \"oh man this is going to be good, what horrible thing could someone say that is worse than kill all black people?\" It never is worse than that though, it's always just some guy who's like \"We should not judge people for the color of their skin\" Reddit's ok with some calls to genocide but saying we shouldn't be racist puts them on high alert! There may be a SJW in our midst! Quick, quick, get him out of here! We were willing to hear out the black genocide guy in case he made some valid points but none of this Tumblr-tier \"anti-racism\" shit! OUT OUT OUT\n\nThis seems to permeate across the whole internet, not just reddit. Internet people LOVE anti-SJW shit more than anything else. It gets old. Redditors love playing devil's advocate all the time, maybe some of them should make pro-SJW arguments, just for the sake of argument. Actually discuss it.

It\u2019s irresponsible and selfish and stupid. But I know people hear are tired of the anti vaxx memes, so here\u2019s my theory: I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that anti-vaxxers are mostly women with children. \n\nWomen have a good reason to distrust the medical establishment. Doctors gaslighting and belittling female patients is a well-documented phenomenon. I mean, my mom had a kidney stone a few years ago and two ER doctors told her it was period cramps before she was diagnosed. I\u2019ve never had serious health issues myself, but I know lots of other women who have been mistreated by doctors. \n\nIt\u2019s even worse when it comes to maternal health. The US still has a disturbingly high rate of death during childbirth. Again, it\u2019s never happened to me, but I know that lots of pregnant women report that their care is dehumanizing and undignified. Catholic hospitals can\u2019t perform emergency abortions because they\u2019re not allowed to ever favor the mother\u2019s life over the child\u2019s. For real, look it up. Doctors and patients have been excommunicated from the Catholic Church for this. People treat pregnant women as if they\u2019re just an empty vessel for a baby. It should come as no surprise that women who have been through pregnancy and childbirth don\u2019t trust doctors. \n\nIt\u2019s not even 100% the doctor\u2019s fault. Women\u2019s health is seriously under-researched compared to men\u2019s. The US medical establishment still tends to think of the only healthy body as a cis male body. No matter how good doctors are, women are still going to be underserved until we get more medical research on female bodies. \n\nSo like, yeah. Anti-vaxxers are unequivocally wrong and they pose a threat to the public health. But sexism in medicine is a much worse public health crisis, and it\u2019s at least partially responsible for the anti-vax movement. Calling anti-vaxxers stupid and showing them statistics and research isn\u2019t going to work. Insults just confirm their belief that the whole world is against them, and they don\u2019t trust statistics for all those reasons I just said. \n\nI mean, think about it. People don\u2019t refuse vaccines because they want their kids to die! They think they\u2019re protecting their kids. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t trust the medical establishment. So logically, to solve this problem, we need to convince mothers that they can trust their doctors. Women are never going to trust their doctors as long as the medical establishment mistreats and underserves women! The only way to end the anti-vaccine movement is to perform more medical research on female bodies so women are safer, and for medical professionals to begin making a conscious effort to listen to their female patients and take their questions and concerns seriously.

The rhetoric shaped the manosphere.    \n\nPUAs promised young men and boys that they held the secretes to \u201chacking\u201d dating. They drew men and boys in by convincing them that they could learn how to get sex from any woman they wanted, or even keep as many women as they wanted in casual sex arrangements (I\u2019m not exaggerating- these were actual promises).     \n\nThen they filled the sub with MRA rhetoric, and constantly pushed a narrative where cool, respected, \u2018alpha\u2019 men got a lot of sex and were mean to women while \u2018beta\u2019 men were pathetic, never got any sex, were secretly despised by both men and women, and were nice to women.     \n\nThey convinced young men that relationships were a competition, and if you were too nice then you were losing. They taught men to carefully curate all their interactions with women so that they maintain dominance.    \n\nThe misogyny was also constant and rampant. Women were portrayed has shallow, robotic, gold digging harpies just waiting for the slightest hint of weakness to take advantage of poor unsuspecting men. The only way to deal with them was to put them in their place, and the worst thing you could do was allow yourself to get real feelings for one and put yourself in a vulnerable position.     \n\nIn other words, the movement made men mean and unfuckable, all while convincing them that their masculinity and self respect was dependent on women sleeping with them. And it taught them to blame women for their humiliation when they weren\u2019t able to get all that sex they were promised.     \n\nIs it *any* surprise that the next big movement in the manosphere called themselves the \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d?

Dehumanization is, as the name implies, implying that someone is less than human, therefore it's okay to deny their rights. Gays are deviants, thus they don't deserve equal marraige rights.

Every mention of rape in the news includes a top-voted caveat in the comments about how the accused didn't actually do it, or how the situation is biased against the man.

The culture on this site is disproportionately hostile towards women and forgiving towards men. This is the definition of rape culture.\n\nException A: If a nonwhite man is accused of rape, he definitely did it, and he deserves everything he gets.

But since none of that shit matters to them you've \"lost\". In their retarded worldview everything is fine, so if all they see are minuses then *clearly* you're just being hysterical. Net neutrality is another perfect fucking example. This is part of why it's so hard to argue with them, because it's always the same refrain: you're trying to fix a problem, and that sounds like it might change what their world looks like so they don't like it. Ask them how they'd fix a problem and their answer will be \"leave it alone\" or \"we don't know it's an issue\".\n\nThey never have any ideas of their own, outside of pretending the problem doesn't exist and that the **estate tax** is what's keeping them from advancing in life further than \"cashier at ShopRite\" or whatever-the-fuck.

How is something like healthcare not constantly affected by politic forces (I\u2019m referring to the linked post)? Healthcare policies can literally save or kill thousands of people a fucking year, stop acting like it\u2019s possible for sides to agree. These people that are always asking both sides to come together come from such a privileged background that they never had to fight for their wellbeing, they are intellectually lazy\/not smart enough to understand nuances, or they are afraid to actually get involved themselves (too comfortable with their lives the way they are). In all of human history, politics has been one of the greatest forces in everyone's lives. Why do people think that we study empires, governments, and political movements in history? They literally shape our lives. Lets stop acting like not choosing any side or not believing in anything makes you some kind of enlightened person. More people need to get involved in political and social discourse, and stop acting like there is common ground when different sides have completely different world views and values (that are non compatible). Example: Why can\u2019t \u2018the Gays\u2019 just get along with religious politicians that want them painfully converted? (During WW2) Why can\u2019t \u2018the Jews\u2019 just peacefully let Nazi\u2019s do whatever they want? Why can\u2019t Palestinians just let their children be murdered without making it a big deal? Apathy and lack of awareness is exactly what got us in the position we are now. It's okay to respect those with different political values (if they are respectable, not all are), but stop acting like those values can come together in some kind of kumbaya moment.

Why do you think there's such a pipeline between these two?","In the 1950s, Tuskegee was a black city run by whites -- who held control with increasing precariousness. Local whites were petrified that they'd finally lose control over the municipal government. So they petitioned the Alabama state government to redraw the city's boundaries.\n\nThe new boundaries, which took the form of a 28-sided shape, included basically every white resident of Tuskegee, and excluded practically every black one. Black residents were redistricted into surrounding municipalities and county governments, diluting their votes and preventing them from attaining power in the city where they lived.\n\nTuskegee was never a major city, but it also wasn't a rural backwater: it was home to what we'd now call an historically black college (the Tuskegee Institute), as well as a large military hospital with an almost entirely black medical staff.\n\nTo be sure, Tuskegee was home to black people from all walks of life, including an especially large number of WWII veterans who had moved in to be near the army hospital. It's important that we don't ignore the working class and poor residents of Tuskegee, who were just as disenfranchised and just as diminished as human beings.\n\nBut this also goes straight to the heart of any notion that southern blacks could have overcome their problems through consciousness-raising or self-improvement or community organization alone.\n\nIn Tuskegee, it was not enough that black people be perfect citizens. It was not enough that one be a doctor who had paid taxes for 40 years. It was not enough that one be a college professor and a decorated army veteran. It was not enough that one be an accomplished attorney, or a successful business-owner, or a librarian with a master's degree. It wasn't even enough that they be a Harvard-educated university president. No black citizen of Tuskegee, no matter how literate or wealthy or polite or well-mannered or magnanimous or persuasive or charismatic or lovely, was considered worthy of the franchise.\n\nIn the end, Black Tuskegee won -- by raising hell, by suing, by protesting, by opposing, by biting the fingers that wagged at them, and by winning at the Supreme Court, thus blowing the top off similar situations all over the south.\n\nHow far do you think they'd have gotten if they'd limited their activism to church luncheons and politely-worded petitions and civil discussions with racist neighbours and engaging in campaigns to eradicate moral lassitude on the part of young black men?","Remember apartheid?

However, we've seen how Trump's promises have panned out. Most of them were never fulfilled, and on top of that, the man has allowed Nazism to become almost normalized in American society. He didn't condemn people emblazoning our country's flag with the Swastika, a symbol that completely represents hate AND a world power we fought against in one of the nastiest wars ever. He repealed net neutrality, he is a fascist condemning any negative news about him as fake, he makes fun of war heroes, he made a whole subset of people no longer exist, he's doing absolutely fucking nothing about the environment, numerous impoverished communities in our country are still in squalor, he's been outed as a sexual predator, AND HE BUILT CONCENTRATION CAMPS (no, just because they're \"illegal\" does not mean they can die at the border).

Trump said increasingly racist and sexist shit, yet people continued to support him. Trump admitted to sexual assault, yet people continued to support him. Trump had a history of denying global warming (which, pre-2016, was a topic that reddit at large was mostly united on), and people started to \"doubt\" environmental scientists. Trump said that vaccines cause autism (another stance that reddit ridiculed for *years*) and suddenly people started to support that position.\n\nThen the topic of Net Neutrality comes up again, which is another thing that the vast majority of reddit *always* defended to the last breaht.

Take a drink every time you hear \"stop being a pussy and just do it\" and it gets upvoted. On a number of these, there's always some asshat who tells everyone how worthless they are (extra points if that person has less than a year of weightlifting experience) and how they need to get their shit together and get motived. It's a tuned up version of \/r\/get_Motivated. Sure, maybe some people could use a kick in the pants, but that's not just giving shitty advice to people. Extra points if they just say eat big and get big or something.\n\nNext is that it translates into pretty much useless advice that isn't in any way applicable and more just a pointed insult. \"How should I work out when I have a full time job and a family?\" \n\n\"Stop being a pussy and just work harder. You have to be motivated.\"\n\nRather than bringing up day to day habits or maybe food prep techniques or something that would actually lead to a tangible change, the common solution is just to shout at each other hoping you can just motivate yourself into something.\n\nWorse is that a lot of mental health subreddits, notably a few that do suicide watches encourage people to exercise to improve mental health--which is definitely a beneficial solution, but you have to be mindful not to send the into these toxic communities and make things worse. That whole bootstraps mentality is especially harmful with that in mind.\n\nYou also have steroid use which is really downplayed or lax with the mindset that \"as long as you're upfront about it and do the research then it shouldn't be looked down on\" and boy is that a shitshow.\n\nYou get the joy of people who look down on anyone who isn't conventionally attractive. Never mind real, documented issues like food deserts, unreliable transportation, time constraints, etc that poor and\/or disabled people have to grapple with. The only time you get a pass is if you have a \"visible\" disability and even then you're just used as workout inspiration porn in the fitness community. It's disgusting. Everyone else gets treated like garbage, and it also plays into the \"Good fatty\" trope where the only overweight people in those circles treated with respect are those actively trying not to be fat. \n\nA lot of the social\/dating groups there have that exact same talking point. \"I don't need someone to look conventionally attractive--I just care that *you take care of your body.*\" On the surface it may sound like that person wouldn't reject someone for really shallow reasons, but 9 times out of 10 they determine \"taking care of yourself\" by not being overweight or underweight. \n\nIt ties into why \"lift lift lift\" is just thrown about as useless dating advice for men (didn't they just say it they wouldn't be shallow about it?), why women are subjected to double standards within the fitness community, how specific exercises and standards pander into beauty standards and lead to \"gendered\" exercises, and just this entire disingenuous idea of using personal or mental health to hide behind when really just looking down on people for shallow reasons. \/r\/fitness among several other fitness subreddit are a huge mess.\n\nNot saying this as a humblebrag, but I've been lifting weights for years now and if you're someone dealing with mental health issues, body image issues, an eating disorder, you're a woman, or really just a decent human being, the best thing you can do is pick what communities you interact with very carefully and take note of what messages you internalize in the fitness world. There are some pretty good subs that do address these very topics, but pick wisely. They can be easy gateways to grab guys into the redpill community, push the whole \"alpha\" bullshit on people, subject women to objectification and even harsher beauty standards, have anyone pick apart your flaws in progress posts, and just be incredibly corrosive to anyone who interacts with them.","What the fuck is wrong with this godforsaken hellhole that people act like the very concept of kindness and empathy will cause their head to explode.\n\nI'm getting so fucking sick of life in general.","This isn't just a Reddit thing, either.

Why is Dadaism so reviled when it so neatly encapsulates the outrage of the public when confronted by difficult to understand aesthetic concepts?

Entitlement is absolutely rife, and any sense of perspective or modestly is lost immediately. Piracy is perennially justified as \"sending a message\" to developers who are \"constantly fucking us over\". Gamers have their sacred cows and their mantras, also. CDPR can do no wrong. Total Biscuit is the be all and end all of gaming. \"Never preorder\" or you're \"destroying gaming\" for reasons no-one has ever been able to satisfactorily explain.\n\nThere's a persecution complex; gamers don't seem to be happy unless they have something to complain about so they can validate their existence as a downtrodden minority. Frequently you'll be accused of \"not being angry enough\" when you try to put things back into perspective in a thread that is slowly snowballing into a witch hunt.\n\nReddit gamers consume games. They don't play them. They don't stop and try to appreciate or contemplate the media they love so much, they run through them like machines. Like it's an obligation.

I feel a similar level of \"What the fuck is going on and how do so many people think this is okay? Why aren't we constantly talking about how not okay this is?\" with relation to the current discourse around the Parkland kids.\n\n\"Well they put themselves out there.\" No shit, that doesn't make it acceptable to call them names or make fun of their physical appearances. They survived a school shooting a month and a half ago. It didn't used to be that you could go on the attack against recent survivors of school shootings, even when they got political. If you disagreed with them, you talked about policies, you didn't attack the kids.\n\n\"Well they're not really survivors of a school shooting, are they? Since they weren't directly shot at. I mean, one of the most vocal ones wasn't even in the same building as the shooter!\" This is another new distinction that has only cropped up in recent days. Nobody used to hair split like this about the victims of school shootings. And it's irrelevant anyway! Their friends and acquaintances still died because of a school shooting whether or not they happened to be in the same building, whatever word you use to describe them.\n\n\"Look at this freeze frame, doesn't it look like he's Sieg Heiling? He couldn't be waving. Therefore, he's a Nazi.\" \"Banning guns is the first step of every authoritarian regime (minus the UK, Australia, and also the vast majority of authoritarian regimes).\" \"Why wasn't the school shooting survivor more respectful to the NRA spokeswoman who attacked him?\" \"I read a (now-retracted) report that one of them wasn't on campus, therefore it's fine to attack all the survivors to the harshest degree possible.\" How do so many people find these arguments to have merit? What changed?\n\nI still half-expect things to be the way they were. When I open up a thread on the Parkland kids being attacked, I expect to see the top responses being like, \"WTF is even going on that people think this is remotely acceptable?\" But instead I see a lot of debate about side-issues and not a lot of the absolute horror and disgust I feel at how these kids are being treated.\n\nIt's not just on the right, either. Both the right and the left have treated the survivors of the Parkland mass shooting badly.\n\nI see right-wing people calling David Hogg an agent of the \"Deep State\" because his dad is an FBI agent, and left-wing people saying that David Hogg can't be trusted because his dad is an agent of capitalism as an FBI agent. I see right-wing people criticizing Emma Gonzalez for wearing a Cuban flag patch that supposedly represents communism, and left-wing people criticizing her because her dad wasn't sufficiently supportive of Castro.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the right is far more guilty of spreading this kind of stuff than the left. It's only right-wing people who are criticizing these kids on their appearances or orientations. And I'm also not suggesting that these kids are beyond reproach for the rest of their lives. Nor am I saying that there were no people with objectionable messages who happened to show up at the March For Our Lives.\n\nWhat I am saying is that it has only been 1 month and 19 days since their classmates were gunned down by a MAGA-hat-wearing white supremacist. These are teenagers who have been thrust into the national spotlight in the immediate aftermath of an immense tragedy in their personal lives, a mass school shooting, the kind of thing that used to shock us.\n\nThey didn't choose who their parents were to be! Why is anyone trying to discredit them through their parents?\n\nThey didn't choose their friends and acquaintances to be gunned down in cold blood! There's no conspiracy! How does anyone fall for that?? There is just a vicious murderer.\n\nIt honestly scares the hell out of me to see so many people so ready to attack these kids--and I don't mean that disrespectfully, but they are basically kids to me at this point--these kids who are victims of a very recent school mass shooting...When has that ever been acceptable before? It hasn't.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that it's clear that while these teenagers have made some political missteps, they've also clearly been trying to do their best when suddenly put under immense pressure by an entire country.\n\nI don't agree with David Hogg when he says that mentally ill people shouldn't be able to own firearms. Mentally ill people are more likely to be victims of crimes than perpetrators. But I do agree with David Hogg when he says that the media has put a disproportionate spotlight on them while not giving black students enough coverage. I don't even want to put a spotlight on this one kid: there are many others more eloquent than he is; he and Gonzalez are just the ones who have been most relentlessly attacked.\n\nAnd I would never even consider attacking them as people just because I disagree on policy! Even far-right whackos had the sense not to attack school shooting survivors like this in the past. But now it's totally mainstream on the right to tar them with lies, conspiracies, insults, and doctored images just like anyone else they disagree with.\n\nI know that there are plenty of other \"wake up calls\" that could have and probably should have made me feel this way. But attacking survivors of a school shooting only a little over a month since their friends and acquaintances were gunned down, that is so far beyond the pale.\n\nDo these people attacking these teenagers have no dignity? How did their hearts get so sick and twisted that you would find attacking high school students who survived a mass shooting on their campus acceptable? You can disagree with their political opinions without becoming conspiracy theorists about a bunch of high school kids. There are ways of disagreeing respectfully and these kids have been nothing but respectful, despite what's being hurled at them.\n\nAt this point I'm just repeating myself. I know I'm also probably preaching to the choir on this subject and it is a topic of mainstream discourse, too. But my heart hasn't hurt like this for society, my mind hasn't been so worried for the future, since the day Trump was elected. In both cases, my feelings are more due to what it says about who my neighbors are and where my society is headed than anything else.\n\n-gbbb","A common alt-right talking point is that European immigrants 'assimilated' to American culture in some vague, undefined way that Muslims are failing to do. Historically speaking it's utter bunk. \n\nThe Irish, Scottish, Italian, German, Polish, and other European immigrants absolutely did not just seamlessly integrate with the prevailing Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture that prevailed at the time. Their arrival brought massive and sweeping changes to American culture in terms of art, fashion, religion, cuisine, sports, and just about every other facet of society you can name. The amalgam that developed only seems natural and intuitive because the alt-right babies are the product of that amalgam; eating a hot dog and going trick-or-treating on Halloween or having either a hamburger or spaghetti for dinner on any given day were not always 'american', they're the results of massive shifts in and diversification of American culture. \n\nYour typical conservative doesn't realize this because they're many-years distant from those shifts, and not particularly educated. If you have even a basic working knowledge of American history, you can grasp that the forming of contemporary American culture wasn't easy, but was the result of immigrants making changes, changes that were met with as much discrimination and bigotry as Muslims are met with today. And you can also intuit that future American culture, that will integrate changes made by contemporary immigrants, will seem as natural and right as contemporary culture today seems, and that contemporary bigots will be viewed as being as wrong and stupid as the 19th century bigots who once declared the Irish and the Italians to be non-white savages.","Why is this always brought up as some \"great equalizer\" of societal injustice? Without fail every \"double standards\" thread has to mention how it's so unfair that some women expect men to pay for their dates. Does no one realize that you don't actually have to do this? Literally no one is making you pay for dates. The vast majority of dates I've been on I've split the bill. It's fun to treat someone in the right situation, but I doubt I would ever date a woman that \"expected\" me to pay for everything. That is a personal choice I made that anyone else is free to also make. \n\nThere is nothing that is forcing you to pay for all the dates you go on. You are free to tell the other person you think you should split it. You may not like the way they react, but that's kind of how human interaction goes. You would think if this was such a massive issue to people they would be happy to find out sooner rather than later that the person they are going out with has these expectations. Then you can move on to try and find someone who you feel more compatabile with. That's how dating works. \n\nIs it really so hard to see that going on a date with a woman who expects you to pay when you don't believe you should might be \"disappointing\" or \"frustrating\", but going on a date with a man who expects you to sleep with him is much more of a threat to a woman's safety? These situations are not the same. The thing is the people who complain about this don't actually want women to pay for half the date, they want women to feel obligated to sleep with them because they paid for the date. ","https:\/\/cruxnow.com\/global-church\/2016\/10\/01\/pope-calls-gender-theory-global-war-family\/\n\nThe pope has decided that gender theory- which he seems to think is equivalent to teaching kids that gender is a social construct- is a threat to marriage. He feels threatened because he sees gender theorists as colonizing and poisoning young children's minds. Somehow. The hypocrisy of the church accusing anyone of colonizing any child's mind is just hilarious, given they they routinely encourage the indoctrination of children from an early age. Not to mention the church's role in *literal colonization* throughout history. That is besides the point, of course. \n\nHis main target seems to be the fact that gender theory implies that transfolk are, in fact, people with valid gender identities. Don't ask me how letting a small number of people with \"unconventional\" gender identities exist is going to destroy the institution of marriage. You'd think that if marriage was such a perfect and holy institution, it wouldn't just fall apart due to the mere existence of a comparatively tiny number of transfolk. \n\nReddit, of course, has eaten this transphobic shit up.

It wasn't until at least a year ago that I realized there was such a general bias against women and black people, and sometimes LGBT people, and it's only gotten progressively worse.

Like the constant hero worship of scientists, like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye, especially the latter. Don't get me wrong, I like those guys, but Reddit elevates them to godhood the year before.

I remember around the time I made my account and for some time afterward there was a fad of scouring through random women's post histories as soon as it was discovered she was a girl. \n\nYou'd see a comment or post that was completely innocuous, like \"I love to use my great-grandmother's recipes to make the same food for my kids that I used to eat\" or \"My boyfriend has the exact same outfit as the guy in this post!\", or sometimes just offering a woman's perspective like \"As a woman, I've always thought it was cute when guys did this\". Nothing overtly sexual, just innocent stuff they wanted to share.\n\nBut reddit would immediately zero-in on the fact that they were girls and search through their post histories to see if they had any naked pictures of themselves. They would comment shit like \"Sorry boys, she hasn't got pics!\", \"Better luck next time guys, I couldn't find any nudes\" or \"Anyone find anything?\" like it was all cute and funny. It was so fucking creepy and such a flagrant violation of their privacy. These women just wanted to share and tell their story just like everyone else gets to but they were instantly singled out for their gender and treated like an object. If, god forbid, there ***were*** nudes in someone's history, they'd post a link to them in the comments with stuff like \"I FOUND 'EM BOYS!\" or \"WE'VE STRUCK GOLD!\" when all these women wanted to do was just participate in the conversation.\n\nJust remembering it makes me mad. I know it seems preposterous but reddit used to be even ***more unfriendly*** toward women than it is now. But even now there's so many people on this site that act like women are never harassed or that creepy stuff never happens to them. I'm not even ***gonna go into*** the fact that the minute an issue that is primarily faced by women comes up, you'll get a chorus of \"whatabout the men!\". Okay, maybe just a little - I have zero problem with men's rights and I'd love to help solve the many problems that men face but those conversations need to happen *organically*, not as a reactionary comeback toward women's issues being addressed. Your goals need to come from a sincere want to make positive change, not as a counterattack.\n\nAnyway, back to what I was saying. This wasn't that long ago and it used to be seen as ***a joke*** for all the techbros on here. Call someone out on how violated you feel? Prepare for the downvotes and being told you're a mean-spirited bitch who hates fun. It was only ever called out as creepy by people who weren't the victim toward the end of it. Now it's mostly forgotten about but those feelings of entitlement toward women's bodies and the objectivism of women in general hasn't gone away. Its still bubbling just under the surface.\n\nTo reddit's credit this site has improved a lot since then. There's more women, more POC, more LGBT, and more minorities now than ever. I think most users today would find this shit despicable and immediately downvote it but that loud subset of the population that found it funny still exists too and they would be all too eager to return back to those days.","https:\/\/www.freep.com\/story\/opinion\/columnists\/nancy-kaffer\/2017\/12\/17\/rape-kit-detroit\/953083001\/\n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"Q: One of the most astounding findings here is that you've identified 817 serial rapists.

I've seen this sentiment around, and I think it's one that deserves further discussion.  \n  \nAmerica isn't in the best place right now.  Far from the country our parents remember, our America has rampant income inequality, unemployment, citizens who cannot afford to pay their medical bills or their student loans.  We've just come out of a hard recession, with a recovery that saw [95% of income gains going to the top 1%,](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/95-of-income-gains-since-2009-went-to-the-top-1-heres-what-that-really-means-2013-9) and new stock market bubbles being inflated even as I type.  There is a lot of very justified anger in this nation, and amongst it's people, and we're all fighting to protect ourselves from an insecure future.  \n  \nThe institutions that were created to protect us have failed us, our leaders have failed us, the establishment has failed us, and it's time for a change.  This is the backdrop for the 2016 Presidential elections.  The Democratic and Republican National committees have presented us with candidates that are part of the same establishment that has so wronged Americans on both sides of the political asile.  The DNC gave Democrats Secretary Clinton, the RNC gave Republicans Governor Bush, and Senator Rubio, but none have been appealing to those of us looking for change.  Out of this populist frustration we received two outsider candidates, candidates who want to change the political system in this country: Senator Bernie Sanders, and Mr. Donald Trump.  \n  \nBoth Trump and Sanders are outsiders of politics, one trying to change the government from within, the other from without.  Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders reflect our frustrations, our pains, and our struggles.  Indeed, we see the establishment of both parties fighting against either candidate being nominated.  On the Democratic side we're forced to fight against a mute media, derisive commentary, and a DNC that only has eyes for Secretary Clinton.  On the Republican side Trump supporters are faced with outright hostility from media on both the left and the right, fighting against an RNC that wants to nominate \"anyone but Trump,\" and even commentary from international sources that have little or no place in American politics.  \n  \nFrom the outside, both candidates have equal appeal to those voters who are frustrated with Washington business as usual, both promise reform, both promise change.  It's easy to understand why someone who supports Senator Sanders could see Donald Trump as an alternative.  When looking solely at the issue of governmental reform, the two seem like different sides of the same coin.  \n \nHowever, past anger at the establishment, the two candidates could not be more at odds with eachother.  While both want to take this country in a new direction, they also want to take the country in *opposite* directions.  I feel that these different directions are not being well articulated in the media, much less on Reddit, and I would like to address some of the subjects on which the two candidates differ.  \n\nI will try to contrast a variety of topics, but this list will be by no means exhaustive, I am choosing to reference those subjects that I think the Reddit community is primarily concerned about.

If we demand evidence of a particular thing, as we should, the systemic discounting of a whole field that allows for proof of those things is tantamount to saying they do not exist because they are not, cannot, or should not be analyzed or studied. This treats the experiences minorities or the disempowered face as negligible, with an implicit sense of this being normal. \n\nAnd this is especially damaging in terms of how it allows for the immediate dismissal of any sort of evidence produced to show that, say minorities may face adverse circumstances in the first place, or that certain expressions of masculinity may hurt men. By blocking the legitimacy of analysis of the problems in our culture, the structures that permit them become further entrenched.\n\nCertainly, some groups stand to gain from this intended silencing more than others.","It's pretty sad Reddit's favorite show is more afraid to insult power than freaking family guy.

You will be monitored closely to make sure you don't shoot anyone with those bullets before you get a gun.\n\nAfter proving to the world you are a responsible gun owner, then you must go back to your doctor that performed the physical and get a letter.\n\nThen, go to each one therapist and psychiatrist, it has to be at least one psychiatrist. They will have to see you on a weekly basis, possibly for a couple years, to determine if you are mentally stable enough to weld a gun. This will most likely be very expensive. You must get a physical letter from each of them (In person, this can't be faxed or mailed), that states you are ready to be a responsible gun owner.\n\nYou will constantly be questioning why you are consistantly getting evaluated mentally for a clearly physical problem. You just need to hold a gun in your hands.\n\nThe process to become a responsible gun owner can be very expensive. It takes the average person whose completed gun safety training $40-$100k to be complete. Typically, there is very little to none financial aide. \n\nThere are only a handful of gun manufacturers in the world. Especially in the united states. Once you are finally eligible to receive a gun, you may have to wait up to an additional 2 years just to have it built!\n\nSadly this is because of people, of society, putting these hurdles in place, put in place by the NRASC, or National Rifle Association Standards of Care.\n\nOf course, if you \"really\" wanted a gun that badly, you'd push through. After all, these artificial hurdles are put in place so that people who shouldn't have a gun don't make a huge, permanent mistake. \n\nIt can be a mentally grating process, as society does not take well to people who do things that very few people do, such as welding a gun. They are typically accused of having mental illness, but the reality is because there is such a stigma to gun ownership it can be hard to find support. Even in non-developed areas. To get a gun, you have to be crazy enough to want to weld one, but not crazy enough that owning a gun will ruin your life.\n\nThere are issues with bringing guns into bathrooms. People automatically assume that if a gun is brought into a bathroom that everyone will immediately get shot up.\n\nI say, this is simply not true. This is not an example of gun-ally theater, I believe there truly are people willing to help those who feel the need to own a gun. I am one of them. Just call me a Social Justice Warrior... for guns.\n\n[As it is right now, it seems to be no shameful coincidence that it is easier to get a gun in our society than gender affirmation surgery, which is horrible because usually a lot of suicidal idealizations come with the way we treat trans people in society. Who really has the untreated mental illness?]","Jesus reddit, the fact that people want to read some literature by people that aren't *all* white isn't anti-intellectual and it isn't racism. If anything it's an effort to expose writers that were stamped out by the anti-intellectual racists of their time. ","While I may be a Biology major, I am disturbed by the amount of sheer trash that liberal arts majors and other \"impractical\" majors get thrown at them. I've seen it online, from my family, and on the news and as a general opinion from people in my area. \n\nI can't help but think that this negativity towards the liberal arts and other non-STEM related majors is causing a deep lack of something critical to ourselves and our advancement as a society and a species.\n\nThere is a great loss that occurs when the only higher education degree that matters is one that is easily translatable to a direct job in industry or research, that the concepts that things such as literacy, history, and art are somehow useless, or worse worth nothing at all.\n\nIt strikes me as almost vaguely fascist. Not in the direct sense, but in how I am reminded that many groups throughout history have always suppressed, silenced, or killed off any of the intellectuals or artistic groups. While not nearly as drastic, I am reminded of this whenever I hear or see someone online or in the real world mock someone who is majoring in English or Art. It's an insult to education, and implies that higher education is only as worthy as the direct applicability to a direct field of work. Nevermind that higher education ideally exists to expand the human mind, and to learn. I don't blame people for wanting to major in something that will guarantee them job security like accounting or so on, but I am sick of the \"I'm just hear to get a job, when are we ever going to use this at work?\" attitude at college. Yeah I don't like chemistry either, but don't interrupt lecture just to be smug.\n\nAnd besides, science research isn't all that great anyway. At least in my area, its cutthroat and most of the people look miserable from the high hours and low pay that science research often entails. Not just that but the sexism and pay gap between women and men. Why should I work 5-7 years for a pHD that has little reward personally or otherwise, where my credit will be claimed by some old fart of a professor, and will have little positive impact on the world. I'd rather learn something else, like learning sculpture or welding or maybe even traveling. And career wise, either a teacher or librarian, always working with the next generation.\n\nIt's this complete faith in science and technology to save us that bugs me. Yes it has and it will continue to, but its not replacement for morality or spirituality. It's no different that praying for rain. The singularity rain-god isn't going to make everything right. If anything, it'll just make things worse and give a minority a literal god complex. Most religious texts emphasize in some words or another, that is up to us to reform ourselves, and to help our friends and family and community either through a god or set of teachings, and to not to wait for tomorrow to come, because tomorrow never comes. There is only the here and now that exists to us, and the window to the future only a glimpse ahead. Do we exit the house through the door in front of us or the window to the sky? This whole faith in science for everything forgets human nature and how it can easily be reinforced to promote negative and greedy amoral behavior. What happens to all the old gadgets, the old computers? Where do they go? Why do we need all of this stuff? Interconnected, spider webs. Why why why. Glittering advertisements everywhere, loud commercials are like burglar salesmen entering our homes. In this godlike worship for science to save us, there is lack of the human aspect. Working towards a mechanized society, following mechanized patterns. \n\nI just wish we would think more about where our technology will take us, and the solutions and problems it might create. Something that people with a liberal arts background are generally trained to emphasize, to think of possibilities, however intangible. While we may not be able to avoid every tragedy, so much can be prevented by just thinking things through. Ugh.\n\nI know there is something lost when we as a society mock anything not industry\/science\/empirical related, but I cannot condense into words that make sense without going into paragraphs. Does that makes sense?\n\nI'm just frustrated I guess. Maybe I need to take a hike. Go back to nature again. Away from this damn city.","Antifa? \u201cSure, beat them up.

The TL;DR is that all negative press about Tesla in the news \\(such as their head of engineering taking time off due to stress, Elon Musk dismissing investment analysts who have genuine questions about the\u00a0*profitability*\u00a0of Tesla as a BUSINESS, and another executive leaving for Waymo, in the wake of all these production issues\\) are NOT legitimate criticisms of the company. No, no, no it's a deep state\/big finance conspiracy theory to lower Tesla's stock price.\n\nThis was so ridiculous that I really had to stop and think about why reddit likes this guy so much, and I think it's similar to the love of Trump by his base.\n\nThe first similarity I see between Trump & Musk: the fact that you'd actually expect their bases to hate them.\n\nTrump\\-\\-as a rich NY businessman who inherited his wealth and has no clue about the struggles of the working class\\-\\-represents exactly what his base claims to hate.\n\nThe same can be said about Musk. Tesla is known for not paying\/overworking engineers, with ridiculous expectations, causing an unpleasant work environment. Reddit of course had a circle jerk of criticism against Steve Jobs over how he treated Apple employees during development of the iPod\/iPhone.\n\nThe second similarity between the two \\(which is why their base likes them\\): the fact that they appear relatable.\n\nTrump, with his simple words, apparent lack of care about his appearance, and total and complete disregard for political correctness, makes his supporters think he's just. Like. Them. Simply put, Trump is what his supporters think they would be like if they became as successful as him. He's what they\u00a0*think*\u00a0a rich person should be like.\n\nMusk is an alpha dude\\-bro techno libertarian with a glorious STEM degree. While Jobs couldn't push his employees because he was a filthy liberal artist who had no right to ridicule engineers, Musk is just being\u00a0*alpha as fuck*\u00a0in his mistreatment of employees. He's living out the redditor wet dream of being an engineer who calls all the shots, who has all the power, who society looks up to.\n\nAnd so, with all this being said, for Trump or Musk's respective bases to criticize them, they would in turn need to criticize themselves, and their aspirations. This is of course not easy to do, so they have to defend their cult heroes at all costs.\u00a0*Whatever you do, don't criticize the man*.","Motherfucker, your ancestors showed up on a boat at Ellis Island.

He's undoubtedly an asshole and there's no call to harass someone for being homeless. That's not in dispute.\n\nBut the comments take thirty seconds to devolve into WELL, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT _I'M_ WHITE AND _MY_ ANCESTORS WERE SLAVES? BLACKS ARE THE REAL RACISTS. CHECKMATE. LOGICKED. And then the predictable bunch of assholery directed toward the guy in the video.\n\nMeanwhile, in another subreddit, someone posted an anecdote about noted racist HP Lovecraft's cat, whose name included the n-word, and another user responded with a fucking _fifteen-paragraph examination_ of Lovecraft's upbringing and how a history of abuse and seclusion led him to be fearful of and prejudiced toward anything unfamiliar. You see, he was only xenophobic in the most _literal_ sense of a phobia: the poor lad was just too consumed with fright to not be racist. And everybody responds to this whole thing with golf claps and \"such bravery, such nuance, thank you for taking the time to illuminate the issue for us.\"\n\nThe thing is that neither of the surface-level reactions to these things is _wrong._ The guy in the first video was a misguided dick and HP Lovecraft's abusive childhood certainly would have had some deleterious effects on the guy later on. But Reddit will froth at the mouth over any excuse to paint minorities as the real assholes while blazing new trails in empathy and investigative journalism to examine why \"oh, it's not _okay,_ obviously, but at least _understandable_ that this poor, downtrodden white man became a virulent racist, you see, it happens to the best of us, no shame in that, none at all.\"","How uncanny.

You're just an innocent victim. You'd never admit this, but you don't really feel bad for women who are catcalled, harassed, or raped, because there's something so understandable to you about the idea of a man \"taking the sexual power back\". You obsess over false rape accusations, because, for one, it helps you rationalize the aforementioned lack of empathy for rape victims, and for two, it  helps you rationalize your preexisting resentments by painting women as soulless.

All shippers are bad and need to leave!\" but I have seen it time and time again and I am sick of it. It's partially due to reddit's anti-tumblr bent, where anything associated with women or youth or queer people is secretly but not overtly condemned. Though, this problem isn't exclusive to Reddit, it just often appears here, packaged along with Reddit's *other* problems.\n\nEssentially, the real reason that people decry shippers is because shippers tend to be queer\/female\/young. There is nothing inherently wrong with shipping but a few select people make it their job to stigmatize the practice so that any shippers feel unwelcome. When you try to reason with them, they will shout \"SJW!\" and \"you think I'm a bigot, don't you?\" seemingly out of nowhere, until you realize the truth. \n\nPeople ship characters mostly because they don't get the representation they want from media. Creators aren't catering to us, so we do it the fuck ourselves. But that concept may confuse some straight men (and some straight women), who ARE being catered to, and can't understand why there's a need to take matters into our own hands. They fall for the anti-shipper's smear campaign and follow them blindly without realizing how anti-girl and anti-queer they're being.\n\nAnyone who says \"Shipping is ruining the fandom for me\" sound like a crybaby.

Society has no problem endlessly abusing men, but now that feminists are trying to abuse little boys things may get sticky.   Most people aren't aware that schools have already been changed to privilege girls (See CH Sommers' \"War Against Boys\"); if they were aware of this we would undoubtedly see more pissed off mothers and fathers.   This time they're doing it right out in the open.   These disgusting harpies and their billionaire\/state backers actually have the gall to tell boys they are abusive privileged oppressors even as they're being drugged with Ritalin and systematically disadvantaged in the education system.   These boys are just learning how to ride a bike for Fuck's sake~!   \n\nFeminist indoctrination is not so terrible in highschool because the kids can just do a google search and easily debunk eg the wage gap.  But the Australian government is trying to teach this shit to boys (and girls) as young as **six*.**   Ironically these lessons were supposedly designed to reduce male on female domestic violence (apparently the reverse doesn't count), even though the Duluth model has long since been discredited.   So their brilliant plan is to engage in the mass mental abuse of boys at the age when they are most vulnerable and when boys are *already* disadvantaged in schools.   Could you imagine a male teacher bullying six year old girls like this?   How pathetic does a person have to be to bully children?   \n\nEdit: Since the particulars of the program itself are not mentioned in this article here is another one: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-australia-37640353\n\n>A guide for the Year 7 and 8 curriculum states: \"Being born a male, you have advantages - such as being overly represented in the public sphere - and this will be true whether you personally approve or think you are entitled to this privilege.\"  [Also over-represented in privileged spheres like workplace accidents and deaths -- about 95% if memory serves]\n\n>It describes privilege as \"automatic, unearned benefits bestowed upon dominant groups\" based on \"gender, sexuality, race or socio-economic class\" [interesting that socio-economic class is placed last on the privilege hierarchy, even though it is by far the most important indicator of actual \"privilege\" -- to the extent that we can even quantify such nebulous concepts; I wonder if that's because most feminists are middle and upper class?].   \n\n>Year 11 and 12 students are introduced to the concept of \"hegemonic masculinity\" which \"requires boys and men to be heterosexual, tough, athletic and emotionless, and encourages the control and dominance of men over women\".  [Excuse me, *requires* men to be heterosexual?   Have these idiots not watched a wild life video?  Are feminists suggesting that we pray the hetero away via feminism like religious fundamentalists demand that gays \"pray the gay away?\"   How in the fuck is this shit being taught in schools?  Nevermind creationism: feminism is the new \"Jesus rode a Dinosaur\"]\n\n>Pay inequality, anger management, sexual orientation and the dangers of pornography [porn is actually strongly correlated with a decrease in violence, sexual or otherwise, against women] will be among the topics explored by students in the programme, costing A$21.8m (\u00a313.5m; $16.5m).   [Gee that money was well spent.   I think it would have been better spent on programs for Australian Aboriginal peoples.   They have the highest rates of domestic violence in Australia -- not due to \"toxic masculinity\" -- but dispossession, poverty and despair.  I think I just blew an intersectional feminist's mind.]\n\nEdit two: Some people have pointed out that this is nothing new (though this takes it to the next level -- I would have assumed that Canadians, Brits or Swedes would have beaten you Aussie cunts to the feminist punch).   As most boys who went to school during the 90's and after can attest, degrading and humiliating little boys is par for the course in modern \"education\" systems.   \n\nIn this article (published in the Guardian no less), the novelist Dorris Lessing (herself a feminist!) condemns a \"female culture that revels in humiliating the other sex.\"   \n\n>\"I was in a class of nine- and 10-year-olds, girls and boys, and this young woman was telling these kids that the reason for wars was the innately violent nature of men.\n\n>\"You could see the little girls, fat with complacency and conceit while the little boys sat there crumpled, apologising for their existence, thinking this was going to be the pattern of their lives.\"\n\n>Lessing said the teacher tried to \"catch my eye, thinking I would approve of this rubbish\".\n\n>She added: \"This kind of thing is happening in schools all over the place and no one says a thing.\n\n>\"It has become a kind of religion that you can't criticise because then you become a traitor to the great cause, which I am not.\n\n>\"It is time we began to ask who are these women who continually rubbish men.

I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors\/social workers\/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. \n\nShe took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be \"fixed\" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. \n\nFlash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I \"don't fit in\" and that my \"views are better suited elsewhere.\" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.\n\nI have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.\n\nThe list:\n-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said \"I didn't see the point\" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; \"there are too many of you and only one of me\" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)\n-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me \"you can't say that!!\" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)","Right now I am so fucking pissed off I can barely post this post.

All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text\/posting like crazy. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. \n\nSo for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered \"creepy\" by doing my job. \n\nThe officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. \n\nUpdate #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me \"that is utter bullshit\" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!\n\nUpdate #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. \n  \n\nUpdate #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it. I guess this is my answer, it never happened.

","I was at the park earlier today for a trick or treating event. My kids were done and playing on some playground equipment. My toddler wants to keep up with her older sibling so she shadows the kid everywhere. My wife and I were chatting with friends maybe 25 meters away.\n\nA set of events led to a much older kid accidentally stepping on the toddler's head. She's okay, but it hurt her and scared her even more. I am fast, so I run over there. My wife trusts me as an equivalent parent so she's cool and let's me take it. Some lady was trying to comfort her. Daughter sees me and immediately reaches for me, because, you know, I'm her dad. I take her. As I'm picking her up the lady tries to hold onto her.\n\n> \"Excuse me, but do you know her?\"\n\n> \"She's my daughter.\"\n\nI put my arms further around her, take her against some noticible resistance from this stranger. She immediately snuggles up to me and cries. \n\n> \"Well, is her mom around?\"\n\nInternally I said, \"Oh fuck off, you sexist piece of shit.\"\n\nExternally I said,\n\n> \"Yeah. I got this.\"\n\nAfter a minute daughter calms down, but the lady never took her eyes off me. Like she was expecting me to kidnap her, or drop her on her head, or I don't know what.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate the concern, but this little girl, who happens to look very much like me, was very clearly expecting me to hold and comfort her. You can relax, lady.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder if this situation would've ever happened had my wife picked her up, or even just some random woman did, would she have acted this way?. I doubt it. Mom's the parent. I'm the auxiliary. I hate that shit. \n\nWe're relaxing on the couch now after a fun evening, both kids snuggled up on each side. Dad's are real parents too.","So after months of complaints and 2 police reports I had my female coworker\nCharged with sexual assault to a minor and fired from place of work!\n\nSo long story short she started 7 months ago and I\u2019m the only male worker where I work and she would constantly grind on me (ass on me) and touch me inappropriately on the chest and butt. I complained to my boss twice but she didn\u2019t care so I filed a police report against said coworker and undocumented everything with pictures and a log of events. She did these gross actions to me every shift I worked with her so I called in almost every shift. I\u2019m 17 so I had to have my parents file it for me cause I\u2019m underaged which was quite embarrassing but I got through it and I\u2019m glad there was actions done to stop her.\n\nSexual assault isn\u2019t just for women, men can be affected too.\n\nEdit: parents helped me file a report, they didn\u2019t do it for me. While it\u2019s really embarrassing to tell them something like this happened it\u2019s probably one of the better things I did, telling someone really does help make you feel like you have someone\u2019s on your side.\n\nEdit: I saw someone asking why I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone, even posts anything asking for help. I think I felt like that\u2019s not supposed to happen and I thought if I asked anyone I would have been scoffed at and told your looking for attention. With that reasoning in my head I started taking pictures, secretly taking videos, audio recordings especially me saying \u201cno\u201d. This eventually led to a well documented log for me to show which I think without it the case would have been dismissed.\n\nEdit: somebody asked if this is going to be public, simple answer is no. I don\u2019t want this to get public I hate attention and frankly this is highly highly embarrassing and I personally just want to keep to myself atm","Nic Cage had a girlfriend for about a year. they got drunkenly married and cage immidiately filed for annulment.

After my ex told me that my parenting time had changed, I realized I am nothing more than a slave. \n\nI had a divorce trial this summer. I have 4 kids, and my daughter has been living with me for the last two years, due to the abuse of her mother. I was petitioning for custody of my 3 sons. Currently, I get every other weekend, and 1 day a week. In the summer, I got them overnight for that day. \n\nI had not received the order from the judge yet, but my ex did. Not only did I not receive full custody, or joint custody, but the court decided that my son's and I didn't need that overnight in the summer anymore. \n\nAfter she geelfully told me that had changed, I started thinking about my and many other fathers situation.\n\n I am a slave.\n\n I am forced to pay my ex wife, and the courts use the love I have for my children to keep me paying. I can't leave, because my kids need their Dad. I also cant leave because the state will do their best to get me back here. I cannot stop paying, because that is illegal. If I quit my job, the state just runs my social security number to see if tax documents have been filed, and they start their immediate money grab.\n\nI am forced into financial bondage, due to not wanting to be married to a woman any longer.\n\n I am good enough of a father to pay for my kids, but not good enough of one to raise them.\n\nWant to know why there is a high amount of male homelessness and suicide? \n\nI am a slave.\n\n\nEdit- Thank you all for the supportive comments. It has definitely helped boost my spirits. To all of the fathers that are experiencing similar circumstance, stay strong. Your kids need you.","In the middle of Pittsburgh, on my birthday, my girlfriend asked me why there were motorized scooters everywhere.\n\nI laughed, I said \u201cthey are called birds, you get an app on your phone and you pay like $5 to ride it all day. When you\u2019re done, you park it wherever and log off of it so someone else can use it.\u201d\n\nShe was intrigued, so I explained more about them and showed her how to use it. As I was, a woman walked by and said to my girlfriend:\n\n###\u201dDon\u2019t you just love his mansplaining\u201d\n\nShe was confused, but laughed at what she said. \n\nI was not amused. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry? I was doing what?\u201d\n\n###\u201dYou are explaining that to her in such a rude tone. She doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\n[Abridged] \n\n\u201cFirst off, who are you and why are you talking to me? Second, mind your business. Nobody was talking to you. I was not being rude. She asked me what the fucking scooter was, so I told her what the fucking scooter was. Why don\u2019t you continue your little journey and go fuck with someone else. I\u2019m not the one, don\u2019t use terms like \u2018mansplaining\u2019 near me. It\u2019s not even a fucking word, it\u2019s a word you idiots made up.

But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   \n\nWhen a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.\n\nThen comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.\n\nHuge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.\n\nBoys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.\n\nTeenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like \"toxic masculinity,\" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.\n\nNext it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.\n\nIf he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).\n\nIf he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.\n\nIn the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate \"diversity\" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that \"blind hiring\" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWith MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.\n\nIf he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new \"baby daddy\" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.\n\nHe will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. \n\nIf a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  \n\nIf he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.\n\nI could go on.\n\nIt is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are \"infinitely superior\" to men.\n\nThe prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion\/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even *more* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.\n\nMen are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.\n\nIf feminism were an \"equality\" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and\/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing \"patriarchy\" that hasn't even been proven to exist.  \n\nAdvocates of gender equality must reject feminism, and support men's rights.  ","In pretty much every aspect of American culture and society, boys are significantly more disadvantaged than girls, and generally have it much harder. Part of this is the general stigma and bias against men that's always been around, (e.g. men are perceived as less valuable, aren't able to express emotions, etc) but a lot of it comes from the modern-day feminists trying to help girls, and simultaneously hurting boys. \n\nI'm a high schooler right now in an American public school, and it's insane the difference in level of support given to boys compared to girls. There are countless clubs and groups meant to support girls in their careers, Women In STEM, Women's Maker-space, Women's Theatre, and a ton of others, and these groups are exclusive to women. Even co-ed activities are constantly trying to get more women in and are focusing more on helping women than the men. This is all done with the best of intentions but what's happening is that boys\/men (who are already at a disadvantage by the education system as a whole) are being completely ignored. Meanwhile to even suggest that men's issues are a problem is a social death sentence, I only give me reddit account out to close friends and this is why. \n\nWhen boys aren't being ignored they're being completely excluded. That women's maker-space is woman exclusive, and there is no co-ed maker-space. I don't have a particular interest in that topic, but I can only imagine being a boy really interested in that, only to be excluded because the feminists decided that the women needed it all to themselves. This rhetoric that's being fed to young girls of \"You can do anything a man can do\" and \"we need more female \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" isn't bad, but it's isolating for boys, who are being fed that their very existence is toxic and that women are the future. Everybody's so focused on telling girls they can do whatever they want that they forgot to tell the new generation of boys.","Like you CAN lose weight idgaf if it\u2019s hard the truth is that it\u2019s possible and if you hate it change it.

But if the man doesn't want it and the woman does- hello child support for the next 18 years!\n\nWhat a load of bullshit.\n\nImgur links:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.imgur.com\/gallery\/Aa05j5d\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kbwPp1Eh.jpg\nhttp:\/\/www.imgur.com\/gallery\/IhRzY6b\nhttp:\/\/www.imgur.com\/gallery\/rE968wk\n\nMy favorite part of all of this: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/4o0v2x\/just_got_banned_from_rrelationships_for_saying_a\/d492q8q","i\u2019d like to start off by saying i\u2019m a 19 year old female who has had a good friend go through this situation. this post is opinion, not fact.\n\nall men have literally zero rights when it comes to having a child, while women have every. they may choose, in most areas, to have an abortion if desired, or give the baby up for adoption if they\u2019re pro-life. so in other words, if a woman is not ready to be a mother, then she is not required to be. however, why aren\u2019t men granted the same choice? \n \nnow i absolutely do not think men should have a say in whether a woman gets an abortion or not. but i do believe they should have the ability to sign away their rights and responsibilities if they let the mother know ahead of time that they do not want a child (in time to have an abortion). we, as women, often advocate for equality. so men should have equal rights in deciding whether they want to be a father or not. and they should not be called names in the process\u2014such as lazy, deadbeat, and disgusting.\n\ndeceit is another big problem. many women lie about being on contraception, or even go as far as pulling condoms out of the trash to impregnate themselves. people will argue for men to put on a condom, however, all that is doing is accusing the victim without addressing the real issue of manipulation. and proper use of birth control (99.8%) is safer than that of a condom (98%). yes, you can stack, but there is still a slight chance, regardless. if a man pokes a hole in the condom, it\u2019s illegal and a form of sexual assault, but it\u2019s not the other way around. and abstinence until marriage is a ridiculous reason to blame a person for an unwanted pregnancy, as this problem happens within marriage as well. so if you think you never want children, but don\u2019t currently want to go through a permanent procedure (vasectomy, etc), you\u2019re never supposed to have sex? yes, there is a risk to intercourse, but there is a risk to almost everything. \n\nwhat do you all think? whether you agree or disagree, i\u2019d like to hear. (:\n\nTL;DR: Women have many rights when it comes to deciding whether they want to be a mother or not, while men have none. Unequal treatment, something many women advocate against, is used often to manipulate men (or women) into having a child. And abstinence is usually an unreasonable argument, as it can happen within marriage as well. Sex is normal and healthy.\n\nedit: had a comment regarding child support. i believe if the male is informed, and lets her know early on he does not want a child, he should not be forced to pay. if she fails to tell him and she has the baby, he should most definitely NOT be forced to pay later on.\n\nedit #2: many people are saying it\u2019s not an unpopular opinion. i wasn\u2019t aware of that, as i\u2019ve never seen a post about this topic have so much support for men and true equality. people usually say to \u201cgrow up\u201d and that it\u2019s their fault for \u201cnot wearing a condom.\u201d not to mention, my friend has zero support or empathy from his family. i\u2019m so glad that many men and women see it as an injustice.\n\nedit #3: i tried to post this in r\/unpopularopinion but they deleted my post. i\u2019m extremely new to reddit (one post previously and less than 10 comments), so i\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s not an unpopular opinion around here. but in terms of how many people think, i still believe it is. thank you to anyone who joined in on the discussion and let me know what you thought!","Please help me, i have a blood pressure problem, and when i checked it the machine showed, blood pressure out of range of equipment, please guide me.\n\n**UPDATE: I just discovered that they have done such orgy atleast 3 times before, i just discovered a facebook group where they planned this, and facebook even told them when i was not at home (it tracked me through the phone), but it didnot track me this time as i had uninstalled, due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal by zuck.

What I\u2019m talking about of course is Fat Steeples. Steeples are a staple to every church or equivalent place of worship and have been around in the world for over 600 years, but recently more and more architects are allowing their steeples to get larger, leading to a dangerously hefty piece of architecture. These architects don\u2019t care about the danger they are causing to others or to themselves with these steeples and thus the world needs to be educated on this issue. Fat steeple acceptance has become the \u201chip\u201d new thing for internet users everywhere and even popular pop artists have written songs about how it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d to have a fat steeple.

His face mashed into the pillow on his king size bed, and his head started rhythmically bumping against the headboard.  He tried to ignore his discomfort, focusing instead on the fact that he had no idea when he'd again get a chance to feel this good, to get fucked this deeply and thoroughly.  One hand was between his legs, stroking his fat six inch cock; he had fallen onto the other.  He was propped up on that elbow, his hand straining to graze one of his nipples.  He was sweating, having been fucked already for ten minutes. He knew from experience he was probably going to get another half hour or so.  A jolt of pleasure coursed through him as he was smacked, hard on his smooth right ass cheek. \n\n\"Yeah, baby,\" said a deep sexy voice, \"you like that, don't you?  I love how your big ass flexes when you get spanked.\"  Paul felt another smack, harder this time, and he let out an involuntary moan and, reflexively, flexed his hard muscular ass.  Paul pushed his arms back under himself, and looked down his torso.  He was on all fours, his massive smooth body was taut, freshly shaved, freshly worked out, and perfectly defined.  His massive pecs heaved with each plunging stroke into his ass, and his abs were tight, trying to balance Paul's big 6'4\" frame against the powerful fucking abuse it was taking.  The only hair on his body, was the carefully trimmed bush at the base of Paul's fat six inch cock, which was totally hard and tightly flexed up against Paul's stomach.  His smooth nuts were tight against his body, resting between Paul's thick smooth legs.  As usual, Paul had shaved his legs that morning, and his massive quads, still sore from his morning workout, were straining to push back against the hard pounding his ass was taking.  Paul loved his body---he would admit, privately, that he was totally a narcissist 'you would be, too,' he would always say to himself as he watched himself in a mirror.  He felt another hard thwack against his backside, and watched his pecs tighten against the heave the most recent stroke had caused.  Between his legs, Paul could see two heavy, massive nuts swinging back and forth with the momentum of the fuck he was getting.  \n\nPaul and James Franco had first met in 2010. They were the two biggest stars in Reddit, and Paul had been curious since he came to town to find out if James was up for fucking him.  One night in 2008, Paul went over to his buddy \/u\/Gallowboob's place for a party for local redditors.  James was there, looking sexy in casual shorts and a Slayer tshirt.  Paul kept trying to catch a glimpse of what was swinging between his legs, but he couldn't get any intel.  After everyone had some food and a few drinks, Paul went to take a piss.  He wasn't paying attention and walked right into the bathroom while James was taking a leak.  The 6'8\" stud had his shorts down and his huge snake in his hand.  Paul tried to stammer an apology and back away, but he was entranced.  James knew it, too.  He smiled and beckoned Paul to come in and close the door.  Paul soon met James's massive eleven inch cut cock with its gorgeously shaped pink mushroom head and the huge nuts to match.  Paul was instantly hooked on James from the first sight, and the long, deep fucking he got that night left him addicted.  Ever since, Paul did whatever was necessary to make sure he got fucked at least once every week by James's big monster.\n\n\"Take that big cock, baby,\" said James, licking his lips as he plunged the full eleven inch length of his cock in and out of Paul's hole.  \"Milk my dick like you want it, bitch.\"  James gave Paul another smack on his ass, leaving a massive hand-shaped red mark on the smooth skin.  Paul's ass clenched with the spank, and he could feel his ass tightening around the merciless invader. The room was silent, except for James's talk, the occasional smack on Paul's ass, and the regular sound of James's tight body ramming into Paul's firm ass, his heavy nuts bouncing against Paul's legs. Paul was in heaven, letting out a long low moan of pleasure as James's cock pounded nearly a foot inside him and then left him empty and aching to be filled again. \n\n\nPaul had done as James liked.  He took a shower an hour before James showed up, taking extra care to make sure he was completely clean.  Then he shaved his arms and legs like he did before a game.  Then he put on a tight pair of white briefs and nothing else.  The curtains were drawn in Paul's room, and the light from the adjoining bathroom was the only light in the room. Paul had stripped his comforter off the bed, leaving only the white sheets and pillows.  Paul opened his garage door, so James wouldn't been seen coming in, turned off lights in the house, and then went to the bed and laid down on his stomach.  James walked into the bedroom with a \"yeah, baby\" at the sight of the smooth impossibly well-muscled stud in his briefs and nothing else.  James was in a wife beater and a pair of loose sweats, tied off so that they hung low on his muscular ass.  James took a knee on the bed, and slapped Paul's ass.  James loved how big and round the QB's muscle ass looked in the tiny white briefs.  He started stroking his big monster through his sweatpants as he caressed Paul's big muscle ass.  Paul looked over his shoulder, showing James his perfect white teeth, and moaned appreciatively as James's hands started running all over Paul's ass.  \n\n\"Damn, you're pretty, boy,\" said James, getting up and walking toward Paul's head.  He pulled the muscular white boy up onto his knees, and Paul dove into James's chest, running his tongue over James's chest hair, as James peeled off his wife beater. Paul worked his way down James's tight, muscled stomach, bathing the taller man in his spit.  Paul dove his face into the crotch of James's sweatpants, and tried to wrap his lips around James's quickly hardening cock.  James reached down Paul's body, and ran his hands under Paul's briefs.  He grabbed a fistful of Paul's hard ass, and Paul could feel his cock jump.  \"Fuck, boy, I'm going to miss this ass when you leave.\"  \n\n\"Damn, James, this ass is going to be lonely out in Denver,\" said Paul matter-of-factly.  \"You'll have to give it one hell of a sendoff.\"  He peeled down James's sweats, grabbed the fat monster by the base, barely able to wrap his big hands around the base.  He opened his mouth, and took four or five inches into his throat.  James's cock throbbed as it quickly hardened.  James had his hands down in Paul's crack, his thick fingers teasing around the warm hole.  He pulled his cock out of Paul's throat, and turned the football stud around, so he could see that big, beautiful ass.  James pulled off the tight briefs, revealing the perfectly round, hard muscle ass that he had conquered.  With the briefs out of the way, James dove into the smooth, hairless crack, and started tonguing Paul's hole.  Paul loved the way James rimmed him, and the tall man had a massive, and powerful, tongue.  James had Paul relaxed and opened up in no time, and had Paul ready to get fucked. \n\nNow, almost twenty minutes into the fuck, James was covered in sweat, and Paul wanted a better view.  Fortunately, James was ready for a change.  \"Roll over, boy,\" said James, withdrawing his huge dick from Paul's gaping hole.  \"Let me see that pretty face of yours.\"  James's head popped out of Paul's hole, and he felt like he was gaping wide open after the pummeling his poor hole had taken.  Paul rolled onto his back, his cock still rockhard against his flat stomach.  His legs were shaking from the fucking he had taken, and it felt fantastic to finally take his weight off them. He stretched his massive arms up over his head, and felt his muscles relax.  James moved onto the bed, and was stroking his cock while he watched his beautiful white fuck toy stretch himself out on the bed.  Paul loved how hot James looked, James's massive dick was rock hard and slick with lube and sweat and spit, having just plowed into the muscle stud.  James's tattoos were glistening with sweat that was dripping down his face and collecting in the valleys of his cut, muscular torso.  His abs and pecs were heaving with each breath.  James looked like such a stud, and Paul couldn't wait to drain his load out of his nuts. \n\n[[Continued...]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/circlejerk\/comments\/372upx\/if_this_gets_to_the_front_page_there_will_be_an\/crj7rff)","Ayyyyyy lookin' to beat my meat like it owes me $$$  ;) ;) ;) ;p\n\nEDIT: upvotes really???\n\nObligatory Edit: wow my first bronze thank you kind internet stranger!\n\nFinal Edit: As of this particular moment, *this fucking post* has surpassed Tom Bergeron's AMA by over a thousand upbreasts.

WHAT?????? LE DANGERZONE!!!!!!! XD XD XD XD XD \n","We screwed up. Not just on September 11th, but also over the past several years. We haven't meme'd well, and we have surprised you with \"fite me irl's\". We have apologized and made promises to you, the users and the memers, over many years, but time and again, we havn't delivered on them.\n\nWhen you've had new dank memes or theme requests, we have often failed to provide concrete results. The memers have lost trust in memes, and in us, the top minds of reddit.\n\nToday, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for circlejerk, and the buck stops with us. We are taking three concrete steps:\n\n**Memes:** We will improve memes, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway. Recently, \/u\/Unidan has been primarily developing new memes for reddit that are largely un-dank. Effective immediately, he will be shifting to work full time on the issues the memers have raised. In addition, many memers are familiar with \/u\/BarbatisCollum's work, as he previously asked for feedback on memes and other dank projects. He will use your past and future input to create and improve memes all around reddit. Together they will be working as a team for you, the memers, on what memes to make and then delivering them.\n\n**Communication:** \/u\/GodOfAtheism is trying out the new role of memer advocate. He will be the contact for memers with reddit. We need to figure out how to better communicate with them, and \/u\/GodOfAtheism will work with you to figure out the best way to talk more often.\n\n**Search:** Will continue to be a flaming pile of shit.\n\nI know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver dank results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion.\n\nThank you for listening. Please share memes here. Our team is ready to respond.","Hehe Xd \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger xd","Edit: thanks for gold stranger ayy\n\nEdit: NSFW\/L care guys lmao\n\n","What the fucking fuck, this got me a mod invite over at \/r\/pokemongocirclejerk.\n\nWE DID IT REDDIT","MY UNDIES ARE SOPPING WET WITH SEMINAL FLUID AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh","Edit: thx 4 gold\nFeel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern Feel the bern ","Please give me karma I just want karma.","I could totally beat Floyd Merriweather ","Edit: Thanks for the karma kind stranger!!!!","t. alberto barbosa","Edit: Hello","sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex","6 million ~~jokes~~ jews stolen and counting...","Edit: PM me your TITS\n\nEdit2:Wow guys, thanks for the TITS!","I woke up to gold for this, wtf ","http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/aMnMytq.jpg","It's as simple as this.\n\nLeave a comment.\n\nGet gold.\n\n**EDIT:** THANKS FOR THE GOLD, KIND STRANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+!!!","[Proof](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xrnx33xoH64)","And knowing you will soon die\n\nedit: wew sirs, this blew up. my highest rated thing ever. \n\ncan someone gold me now pls","\"Give me karma\"\n- Steve Jobs\n\nEdit: BERNIE WON!!!","EDIT: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nle ninja edit, amirite ????

","That's my opinion now give me karma\n\nEdit: wow this made my inbox blow up!","Hi reddit. dhamster here.  \n  \nI wanted to bring up an important reminder about how folks interact with each other online. It is not a problem that exists solely on reddit, but rather the internet as a whole. The internet is a wonderful tool for interacting with people from all walks of life, but the anonymity it can afford can make it easy to forget that really, on the other end of the screens and keyboards, we're all just looking for karma. Virtual, meaningless internet points to aspire for in place of lives and goals and fears, earned by agreeing with our favorite TV shows and books and methods for breeding Pokemon (Firefly, Game of Thrones and the Masuda method, respectively), and each and every last one of us has opinions. Sure, your opinions might differ from your own. But that\u2019s not okay. People are not entitled to their opinions, if they are different from yours. When you argue with people in person, do you say as many of the hate filled and vitriolic statements you see people slinging around online? You probably do, right? Good job! Please think about this next time you're in a situation that makes you want to lash out. If you wouldn't say it to their face, perhaps it's best u better shut ur mouth u cheeky little cunt i swer to christ ill hook u in the gabber m8.  \n  \nTry to be discourteous to others. See someone having a bad day? Downvote them or tell them to fuck off, and it might make their day better. Did someone reply to your comment with valuable insights or something that cheered you up? Send them a profanity-laced message letting them know you appreciate their comment.  \n  \nSo I ask you, the next time a user picks a fight with you, or you get the urge to harass another user because of something they typed on a keyboard, please... remember the karma.","dank memes","Edit: thanks for the gold","EDIT: Thanks for the sex!","Be angry about what ***I*** want you to be already.","Bernie Sanders for pope 2069","Edit edit edit edit: xDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2588\u258c\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591\u258c\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n \u2591\u2591\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u258c\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n \u2591\u2590\u2588\u2580\u2584\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u258c\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \n\n\u2591\u258c\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u258c\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\n \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591le\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591 \n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591toucan\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\n\n \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591has\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584 \n\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591arrived\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591","Karma","Proof: http:\/\/m.imgur.com\/s33gFDE\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold stranger\n\nEDIT2: Wow I was at work sleeping all day and just got home to see these comments.

I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.\n\nSince many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved.

MENNINGER) Okay. \n\n-\tA) I now know that it was 2000, that I was 16 years old when I met Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nPage 136\n\n-\tA) It wasn't until I found the facts that I worked at Mar-a-Lago in 2000 that I was able to figure that out.\n\n-\tQ) (BY MS. MENNINGER) And approximately when did you learn those facts about the dates you worked at Mar-a-Lago? \n\n-\tA) I would say it was mid-2015.\n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 137\n\n-\tQ) Okay. Now tell me how you sort of came into Mar-a-Lago for the first time? He asked you to come? They called you? What happened? \n\n-\tA) My dad was very liked there. So I think he talked to the people who were in HR. And then\u2026 (document cuts off)\n\nPage 140\n\n-\tQ) How long did you work at Mar-a-Lago? \n\n-\tA ) Best of my recollection, it was a summer job. I believe I started in June. And I think I only worked there approximately two weeks, two, three weeks.\n\n-\tQ) How many hours a week did you work? \n\n-\tA) I want to say it was a -- I want to say it's a full-time job. \n\n-\tQ) Do you recall it being a full-time job? \n\n-\tA) It was a summer job, but just thinking back, my dad used to bring me in and bring me home. So he worked full time, all day. So -- and I didn't lounge around Mar-a-Lago so, yes, I think it would have been a full-time job. \n\n-\tQ) And how much did you make per hour? \n\n-\tA) Approximately, I think I remember making $9 an hour.\n\n-\tQ) The bracelet and earrings you got for your birthday, some birthday, on Little -- or where was that birthday party, at Little St. James? \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 141\n\n-\tQ) When do you recall ever getting a cell phone? \n\n-\tA) The first cell phone I ever got was the one that Ghislaine gave to me.\n\n-\tQ) Okay. So tell me what you recall of the first conversation that you had with Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\n-\tA) I'm sitting there reading my book about massage therapy, as I'm working in the spa. And I'm getting my GE -- well, I was in the process of getting my GED before I went to my summer job. I decided that I would like to become a massage \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 142 \n\n-\tQ) When you say living with you, were you guys staying in the same room? \n\n-\tA) Yes.\n\n-\tQ) Were you engaged at that time to him? \n\n-\tA) That was a really weird relationship. He was a friend who looked after me, and he did propose to me and I did say yes.\n\nPage 144\n\n-\tQ_ Okay. Where were you sent to have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain by Ghislaine Maxwell?  MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.  A) I believe that was one time in France.\n\n-\tQ) (BY MS. MENNINGER) Which time in France? A) I believe it was around the same time that  Naomi Campbell had a birthday party.\n\n-\tQ) Where did you have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain in France around the time of Naomi Campbell's birthday party? \n\n-\tA) In his own cabana townhouse thing. It was part of a hotel, but I wouldn't call it a hotel. Jeffrey was staying there. Ghislaine was staying there. Emmy was staying there. I was staying there. This other guy was staying there. I don't know his name. I was instructed by Ghislaine to go and give him an erotic massage\n\n-\tQ) She used the words erotic massage? \n\n-\tA) No, that's my word. The word massage is what they would use. That's their code word.\nPage 145\n\n-\tQ) Where did you go to have sex with Marvin Minsky? A) I believe it was the U.S. Virgin Islands, Jeff's -- sorry, Jeffrey Epstein's island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n-\tQ) Other than Glenn Dubin, Stephen Kaufmann, Prince Andrew, Jean Luc Brunel, Bill Richardson, another prince, the large hotel chain owner and Marvin Minsky, is there anyone else that Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to go have sex with? A) I am definitely sure there is. But can I remember everybody's name? No.\n\nExhibit O\n\nPage 154-162\n\n-\tPhoto of documents involving school documents\n\nExhibit P\n\nVIDEOTAPED DEPOSITION OF TONY FIGUEROA\n\nPage 1173\n\n-\tQ) And just to be clear, she already lived in the apartment? A) Yeah. She lived in the apartment with her ex-boyfriend Michael and JJ. And I think there was somebody else. I don't remember who, though.\n\nPage 174\n\n-\tQ) When did your relationship with Ms. Roberts end the second time? \n\n-\tA) When she went to Thailand and never heard from her again. \n\n-\tTHE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry. Can you re-answer?  \n\n-\tA) Yeah. When Jeffry sent her to Thailand. And then I never heard from her again until freaking, like, two days ago.\n\nPage 176\n\n-\tQ) Did Ms. Roberts ever tell she had met a senator? \n\n-\tA) Not that I'm aware of. I mean, she's told me that she met a bunch of people before. And after it started becoming, like, an almost everyday thing about -- just hearing about famous people with Jeffrey and stuff like that, it's, like, I kind of didn't, like, tone it out, but I just -- it became normal, so I just stopped, like, listening to all the details, because I was not going to meet these people, you know what I mean? It's just, like, all right.  \n\n-\tQ) Was she excited that she was meeting famous people? \n\n-\tA) Yeah.\n\nExhibit Q\n\nCONFIDENTIAL VIDEO DEPOSITION OF VIRGINIA GIUFFRE\n\nPage 189 \n\n-\tRelated to employment at other places\n\nExhibit R\n\nPage 195\n\n-\tSocial security evidence between 1998\u20132002 and 2013-2015\n\nPage 196\n\n-\tRecord do not show the exact date of employment (month and day) because SS do not need this information to figure Social Security benefits.

Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? \n\n-\tA) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. \n\n-\tQ) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? \n\n-\tA) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. \n\n-\tQ) Is that the coolest time? \n\n-\tA) Times of the year, yes. \n\n-\tQ) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? \n\n-\tA) Yes. \n\n-\tQ) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?\n\nPage 224\n\n-\tA) Yes. \n\n-\tQ) You saw that happen every year that you were there? \n\n-\tA) Every year. \n\n-\tQ) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? \n\n-\tA) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. \n\n-\tQ) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? \n\n-\tA) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. \n\n-\tQ) I understand. \n\n-\tA) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 225\n\n-\tA Where did I learn that? \n\n-\tQ) Uh-huh. \n\n-\tA) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. \n\n-\tQ) When did Virginia tell you this? \n\n-\tA) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.\n\n-\tQ I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? \n\n-\tA) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job\n\nPage 226\n\n-\tQ) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? \n\n-\tA) Once. \n\n-\tQ) When was that? \n\n-\tA) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.\n\n-\tQ) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? \n\n-\tA) Yeah. \n\n-\tQ) Was it later? \n\n-\tA) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.\n\nPage 228\n\n-\tQ) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? \n\n-\tA) Not that I remember ever meeting her.\n\nExhibit U\n\nPage 232 \n\n-\tThe Mar-a-Lago Club, L.C.

I asked both of them and the other mods what was going on and [this was the response.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/cRJRk) I was issued global bans from the numerous subreddits that these mods control for having opinions that they personally disliked. They wrongly slandered me as a racist and banned me for saying things outside of the subreddits they mod that they didn't like and this is in keeping with their past tyrannical behavior. [This isn't the first time we've seen this type of mod abuse for having opinions\/views that mods don't personally agree with and being labeled a racist for holding them in an effort to eliminate dissent and\/or open discussion.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/cQE96) davidreiss666 has been purging and censoring opinions on reddit that don't align with  his Leftist views for as long as he has had power here. He corruptly ran \/r\/politics before being thrown out and he mods Left wing subreddits like \/r\/postnationalist, \/r\/Green, \/r\/Liberal, \/r\/labor, and \/r\/neoprogs (New progressives). Here is his rap sheet as one of reddit's most dictatorial, biased, and corrupt mods.\n\n[In 2012, davidreiss666 was responsible for serious mod drama that led to a near-meltdown in \/r\/Canada. He was constantly removing posts, spamming the subreddit with Left wing posts with his secret alt account, and banning users who posted views that went against his Left wing positions. The entire subreddit turned on him and eventually managed to push him out of the mod team.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/tKwtX) [He is so bad that he managed to have a reddit admin kick him out of \/r\/ideasfortheadmins because he was up to no good.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/T0Fy5vw.png)\n\n[He has a history of the same type of behavior in \/r\/europe as well.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/fKYZV) The last screenshot is from voat.co and was posted by a user this week who noticed what davidreiss666 has been doing in \/r\/europe and how he is trying to control the subreddit just like he did with \/r\/Canada before he was thrown out of there. [Here is a link to that post from voat.co for you to read.](https:\/\/voat.co\/v\/MeanwhileOnReddit\/comments\/98027)\n\nIt doesn't stop there. In what was probably his most blatant act of abuse and corruption, in 2013 he used his mod power to censor people exposing his shady moderation of and posting in \/r\/politics. He caused immense drama and got serious attention on the front page of reddit for trying to get rid of someone who got tons of upvotes for calling him out as a spammer and shill in \/r\/politics. \/r\/politics was removed as a default subreddit by the admins because of mods like davidreiss666 running it in a way that allowed him to create what has to be the biggest political echo chamber filled with Left wing bias on the entire internet.\n\n[One,](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j3mYRZp.png) [two,](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OcUioEr.png) [three,](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tFhlu5P.png) [four.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/O4ymS)\n\n[Read the comments in this \/r\/SubredditDrama thread about this incident to really see what this guy is about.](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/1ckgu1\/bestof_links_to_rmurica_comment_calling_out_the\/) \n\nHis behavior hits close to home for those of us here at \/r\/conspiracy as well since [he was the mod responsible for banning links from this subreddit to \/r\/bestof.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/aE8jT1p.png) He is lying when he says that the other \/r\/bestof mods \"agreed\" with the banning since it doesn't matter what any other mod thinks because he is the de facto top mod of the subreddit. The mods above him pay no attention to \/r\/bestof and are inactive.\n\nHe happens to be friends with and mods subreddits with agentlame. Both of them were in part responsible for the total meltdown of \/r\/technology in Summer 2014 that led to the admins temporarily having to remove its default status. [Here is a good look at the way these two moderate together.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/aOMHl)\n\nI posted this today because I have had enough of the wrong turns that reddit has been taking recently with its many biased, authoritarian, and terrible moderators. I felt the need to share this information with all of you just in case you weren't aware of how bad the problem has gotten on this site. Between mods like this and Ellen Pao forcing this site to become [a \"safe space\" instead of a place for the most open and engaged discussion on the web,](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Ib6kT) I felt the need to show those who don't know about two of reddit's most dictatorial mods just how perfect they are for the new reddit under Ellen Pao. \n\nAs for my bannings and the reasons given by these two mods, I reject their view that I am a racist and that I deserve to be banned from every subreddit that they moderate for this accusation. I make no apologies for and do not reject the view that I hold conservative and right of center opinions on certain issues. I reject the notion that the views I hold are inappropriate, that I have no right to participate in discussion in the many subreddits that these mods control due to my views, and I know that the censoring of myself and others for holding these views is the wrong way to run subreddits that are supposed to be places for open and varied discussion. \n\nI'm not advocating for the right to spam racial and\/or other hateful slurs in a subreddit. I'm not demanding the right to yell \"FIRE!\" in a crowded theater or subreddit either. I'm staunchly in favor of the right to hold opinions that cut against the grain and that challenge others to think and to address beliefs that may not be popular or widely-held. I actually believe that the reason why I was banned from hundreds of subreddits is because these two mods were angry that people were giving [positive attention to the views that I hold](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TG1uY) since my views apparently do not align with their own.\n\nIf I have to choose between a safe space where my ideas aren't challenged or deemed worthy of sharing, where I have to walk on eggshells not to push the envelop too far, or where I have to think twice about every \"controversial\" view that I hold before posting then you can count me out. I like a reddit where we're all able to post freely without any sort of coercion from mods or admins that makes us alter or sanitize what we say and\/or to scare us from saying anything at all that would be deemed inappropriate by biased, authoritarian neckbeards like davidreiss666 and agentlame. If you've read this far, I hope you're in favor of the latter reddit and not the former.\n\nEdit: The top comment in this thread is telling me that \/r\/subredditcancer is the place for this type of post so I will post this over there as well. \n\nEdit: I've just been told that \/u\/davidreiss666 is talking about this post in his backroom private subreddits with his other power mods and his sycophants who are telling him he's not to blame for anything that I've exposed and dug up here. He's such a coward that he won't respond to this post in any public subreddit where people can challenge his poor behavior but he'll act like he's not a piece of garbage in his private subreddits with other authoritarian neckbeards just like him who all tell each other that it's everyone else who is the problem reddit but not them.

Not even whispers and this is a really big problem. As if we didn't need another reason to despise Reddit Inc. even more and as if they didn't need to give Aaron Shwartz another reason to roll over in his grave (RIP), Reddit Inc. gives us and Aaron yet another reason. \n\nReddit Inc. is about to strike a deal with one of the most powerful censorship fueled companies in the world. This company is the SAME company that worked\/works hand in hand with China to build the infrastructure upon which China deploys its' intense censorship controls. \n\nThe company is called Tencent, \"the first ever Asian technology company to pass a $500 billion market value.\" Journalist Patrick Howell O'Neill, a journalist employed by gizmodo, states that \"the apparently impending Reddit-Tencent marriage is complicated by the fact that Reddit, one of the most popular websites on the internet, is regularly\u2014and is currently\u2014blocked in China as part of the world\u2019s most notorious and sophisticated censorship regime, the Great Firewall of China.\"\n\nPatrick goes on to say, \"Tencent is, at great cost and ultimately for great profit, literally reinventing censorship in China. The Great Firewall was not built by the Communist Party in Beijing, it\u2019s built by the tech giants all around China. This opaque but clearly powerful relationship between the $500 billion company and the Chinese government raises interesting and unanswered questions about Tencent\u2019s forays into the West, including questions about Reddit\u2019s future.\" \n\nHe goes on to say, \"Reddit, which in the recent past had numerous executives say the company stood \u201cfor free speech,\u201d is of course not alone in receiving the Tencent cash. In addition to Snap and Discord, Tencent\u2019s accelerating investment program has grabbed a piece of over 600 diverse companies globally.\"\n\nTo read the full article I am quoting from and get more information, **[click here](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/reddit-banned-in-china-is-reportedly-set-to-land-150-1832375439)**\n\nSo what does this all mean? It means a variety of things. It means that Reddit Inc. will now be controlled and operated by one of the largest censorship ran companies in the world. A company that works hand in hand with China to censor it's citizens and control what they see and do not see. It means that this company will now have access to all of the information they can collect about you on Reddit. \n\nAs it is, websites like [snoopsnoo.com](https:\/\/snoopsnoo.com\/) can generate pretty accurate information about you simply based on your comments.

Ms. Maxwell \u201cfacilitated\u201d Ms. Giuffre\u2019s \u00a7 sex with Prince Andrew \u201cby acting as a \u2018madame\u2019 for Epstein.\u201d \u00a7 Ms. Maxwell \u201cassist\\[ed\\] in internationally trafficking\u201d Ms. Giuffre and \u201cnumerous other young girls for sexual purposes.\u201d \u00a7 Ms. Giuffre was \u201cforced\u201d to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others \u201cengage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.\u201d\n\nPage 234\n\n\\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.\n\n\\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time\n\nPage 243\n\n\\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.\n\n\\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08\/09\/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.\n\nPage 244\n\n\\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.\n\n\\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.\n\n\\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.\n\nPage 245\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.\n\n\\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was \"the boss\" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.\n\n\\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein\u2019s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.\n\n\\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.\n\n\\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**\n\n\\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.\n\nPage 246\n\n\\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.\n\n\\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.\n\nPage 264\n\n\\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn\u2019t cause Epstein to orgasm.\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.\n\n\\- the butler for Defendant\u2019s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.\n\n\\- Call this the \u201cyes-I\u2019m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls\u201d defense.\n\nPage 265\n\n\\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre \u2013 although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.\n\n\\- Defendant\u2019s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.\n\nPage 266\n\n\\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein\u2019s private jets \u2013 the \u2013 Lolita Express\u201d \u2013 with Defendant at least 23 times.\n\n\\- Ms. Sjoberg\u2019s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg\u2019s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein\u2019s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08\/09\/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg\u2019s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.\n\nPage 268\n\n\\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion.\n\n\\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre\u2019s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg\u2019s breast.**\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.\n\nPage 269\n\n\\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:\n\nPage 270\n\n\\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears \u2013 how, while working at Dubin\u2019s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin\u2019s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.\n\nPage 271\n\n\\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre\u2019s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre\u2019s \u201cnew momma.\u201d 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.\n\n\\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police\u2019s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein\u2019s lawyer.\n\nPage 272\n\n\\- Notably, at Defendant\u2019s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein\u2019s pilot\u2019s flight logs.13\n\n\\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials \u2013 GM \u2013 was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.\n\n\\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant\u2019s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.\n\nPage 273\n\n\\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant\u2019s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.\n\nPage 274\n\n\\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one \u2013 to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.\n\n\\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.\n\n\\- Another one of Defendant\u2019s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre\u2019s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre\u2019s \u201cnew mamma.\u201d Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein\u2019s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein\u2019s procuress.\n\n\\- Others who lived with her \u2013 Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen \u2013 invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.\n\n\\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile\u2019s private jet all over the world.**\n\nPage 275\n\n\\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre\u2019s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.\n\n\\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre\u2019s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant\u2019s house in London.\n\n\\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre\u2019s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.\n\nPage 276\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein\u2019s New Mexico Ranch.\n\n\\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08\/09\/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.\n\nPage 277\n\n\\- In 2008, the United States Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected \u201cvictim\u201d of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter.

The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.\n\nPage 278\n\n\\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre\u2019s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice\n\n\\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre\u2019s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre\u2019s abuser.\n\nPage 279\n\n\\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.\n\n\\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates\u2019 sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach residence.\n\n\\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell\u2019s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell\u2019s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.\n\nPage 280\n\n\\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, \u201cGM,\u201d took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.\n\nPage 282\n\n\\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for \u201cwork\u201d explaining that she does not have any money. The term \u201cwork\u201d was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from \u201dI need work. I mean I don\u2019t have money. Do you have some work for me?\u201d\n\n\\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe\n\n\\- Giuffre 001428 \u2013 undated Jeffrey From \u2013 \u201cHas girl for tonight\u201d ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)\u2013 7\/9\/04 \u2013 Mr. Epstein From \u2013 \u201c is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow\u201d; GIUFFRE 001433 \/1\/17\/04 \u2013 Mr. Epstein from \u2013 \u201cMe and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone\u201d ; Giuffre \u2013 001452 \u2013 undated Jeffrey from \u201cHas girl for tonight.\u201d\n\n\\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)\u2013 JE from \u201cN\u201d \u2013 \u201c hasn\u2019t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn\u2019t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8\/20\/05 JE from - confirmed \\_\\_\\_ at 4 pm.

She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.\u201d\n\nPage 283\n\n\\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell\u2019s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08\/09\/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001412 \u2013 9\/10\/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from \u2013 \u201cI went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.\u201d\n\n\\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from \u201cLarry\u201d demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein\u2019s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001435 7\/25\/04 \u2013 Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell \u2013 \u201ctell him to call me\u201d; Giuffre \u2013 001449 \u2013 8\/22\/05 \u2013 JE from GM; Giuffre \u2013 001453 \u2013 4\/25\/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry \u201creturning your call\u201d;\n\n\\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.\n\n\\- Giuffre \u2013 001454 \u2013 undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine \u2013 \u201cWould be helpful to have \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.\u201d\n\n\\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to \u201cstay in school.\u201d\n\n\\- \u201d Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)\u2013 Jeffrey 2\/28\/05 Redacted name \u201cShe is wondering if 2:30 is o.k.

Indeed the \u201c \u201d reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the \u201d that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s home.

These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) \u2013 including \u2013 identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.\n\n**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**\n\n\\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s trash.\n\n\\- The books he ordered are titled:\n\n(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;\n\n(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude \u2013 Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 \u2013 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08\/09\/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24\n\n\\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre\u2019s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein \u2013 not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.\n\nPage 287\n\n**Thailand Folder with Defendant\u2019s Phone Number**\n\n\\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.\n\n\\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.\n\n\\- On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words \u201cCall Ms. Maxwell (917) !\u201d on Virginia\u2019s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.\n\n\\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre\u2019s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.","https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Political_Revolution\/comments\/5aqb8u\/wikileaks_bombshell_exposes_extent_of_clinton\/\n\nThis is big.

Please DM me if you would like the link and\/or would be willing to help or share the link. \n\nI took my parents to Chicago Friday night and stayed at a Marriott on the Magnificent Mile. I got a room for my parents and one for myself. We were in town for my father's mom's funeral. My father has early signs of dementia and he is on several medications.\n\nAround 7:30am. my father stepped outside of the hotel to smoke a cigarette (upon my mother's approval which I am still frustrated with), and has not been found since. I have filed a missings report with CPD, but they have not been helpful at all. I understand it is a big city, but I am pretty sure they are just waiting for him to pop up. I am very concerned, because he has not had his medications. He does have seizures and I am afraid he may have had one or passed out somewhere downtown.\n\n\nI personally walked 12-15 hours yesterday all around downtown looking for him. After the funeral, some of the family came downtown to help search, but we have not been able to find anything. I have left numbers at the homeless shelters in that area as well as the hospitals. Please upvote this to help me find him. I left pictures on this post. He was wearing an all black suit with a black hat. The first picture shows exactly what he was wearing. I know it is blurry. Please Chicago, help!\n\n\nTL;DR My father went missing on the magnificent mile. He stepped outside of the hotel and has not been found after 35 hours. He has dementia and I am very concerned regarding his well-being.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/SWRW3XU\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/EIByOfe\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: My father has been found! \n\nHe was found in the area near Thorek Memorial Hospital. A fellow Redditor thought they saw him at Cummins Playground and judging by where he was found, I do believe they actually saw him. I searched this area all through the night but I didn\u2019t have any luck. The police were notified when he was spotted and he was promptly taken to the hospital. \n\nHe was severely dehydrated and his feet were raw from walking barefoot. He had gotten a new pair of dress shoes the night before he went missing and he ended up taking those off while walking. My father says he left to go get my mother, him, and I some pop from 7\/11. When he was found, he was carrying 2 two liters and was reportedly very excited to finally give my mother  the pop. \n\nThe police say when they approached him and asked him how he was doing he said he was walking home. He claimed to live just up the road...\u201din Goshen\u201d. He was obviously very confused but I think he has a better understanding of what happened now than he did when he was found. He is out of the hospital and resting until his feet have recovered enough to allow him to walk with no pain. \n\nThank you Reddit for the help! As I said before, I do believe a fellow Redditor spotted him and so I know my posts did help. I told the police he may be in the area where the Redditor said they saw him, and he was found a day later.  A special thanks to this subreddit for allowing this post to stay. This was the community where I got most of my tips and received the most attention. I know this may not have been related to this subreddit and so I appreciate the mods leaving it up and exercising discretion. I know a lot of people reported my post. Thank you Mods!!!\n\n\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to support the costs I incurred while searching for him. My car was towed while I was out looking for him and I ended up paying $316 to get it out. I will also use any funds from the GoFundMe to get my father some type of tracking device....either a watch or a necklace that he can wear.

","**UPDATE: WITHIN 30 HOURS OF MAKING THIS POST, I WAS SITE-WIDE SHADOWBANNED \"ACCIDENTALLY\", I AM NOW UNBANNED (See *new* point #14 for details) _________\n\n1) **The first thing they did was take away r\/reddit.com.** \n\nThis took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r\/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.\n\n2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**\n\nI remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r\/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious [campaign to filter him out of the election](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary).\n\n3) **Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  \n\nI remember when r\/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be \"approved\". Someone named [Victoria](https:\/\/engage.vevent.com\/index.jsp?eid=3110&seid=111) is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding\/PR\/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and\/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.\n\nThere are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. [Check out this post which was pushed into r\/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r\/technology.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/undelete\/comments\/22yewf\/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are\/)\n\n4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** \n\nAll of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere.

Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.\n\nNot to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.\n\nMajor politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media. \n\n6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**\n\nWe now have an entirely new way to view upvote\/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47\/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.\n\n7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random** ^\u203f^ \n\nNo more r\/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r\/nottheonion.\n\nAnd speaking of the female demographic and \"gender discrimination\" being represented, that happened around the time [this person](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/search?q=ellen+pao&restrict_sr=off&sort=relevance&t=all) took over as CEO of reddit.\n\n8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**\n\nIt now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years.

Everyone must think the *exact* same way about complex geopolitical events.\u201d\n\n12) **All of the proper \"checks and balances\" are now in place.** \n\nR\/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:\n\n>a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.\n\nBut when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!\n\nLook what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, [the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/04\/19\/reddit-ddos\/). Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said \u201cHey everybody, these two guys did it!\u201d For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government\u2019s word, and the ~~manufactured~~ consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, **without any other evidence**, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.\n\nAnd speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can\u2019t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.\n\n13) **Online guerrilla tactics.**\n\nWhen reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https:\/\/voat.co\/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?\n\nDid you guess: \u201cThousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website\u201d? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen.

I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer \"be found\". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban. \n\nSo I made a new account and made [this post](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/30hy5r\/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went\/) about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:\n\n>It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.\n\nI have no idea what \"vote brigade\" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a \"vote brigade\". \n\nAnyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of \"yeah, our bad\". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban \"accidentally\" within a day and a half of my most viral \"How Reddit Was Destroyed\". \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\n\nIt wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.\n\nNow we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the [Eternal September](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eternal_September) syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their [useful idiots](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Useful_idiot).\n\n**I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. [Manufactured consensus](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manufacturing_Consent) is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.**\n\nThe people who run reddit are not the \"cool bloggers\" they try to portray themselves as.

","PROOF OF HIS CLAIM HE WAS AT THE DERMATOLOGIST\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/9ScGZCqEyGM\n\nEdit 3: a better source than the original.\n\n\n\"Controlling Interests\n\nOwnership, Control, and Insurance of The World Trade Center\n\nThe World Trade Center complex came under the control of a private owner for the first time only in mid-2001, having been built and managed by the Port Authority as a public resource. The complex was leased to a partnership of Silverstein Properties and Westfield America. 1   2   The new controllers acquired a handsome insurance policy for the complex including a clause that would prove extremely valuable: in the event of a terrorist attack, the partnership could collect the insured value of the property, and be released from their obligations under the 99-year lease. 3  \n\n\nOwnership Change\n\nAuthor Don Paul investigated this and related issues for his 2002 book, which contains the following passage detailing financial aspects and ownership changes of the complex preceding the attack.\n\nOn April 26 of 2001 the Board of Commissioners for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey awarded Silverstein Properties and mall-owner Westfield America a 99-year-lease on the following assets: The Twin Towers, World Trade Center Buildings 4 and 5, two 9-story office buildings, and 400,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nThe partners' winning bid was $3.2 billion for holdings estimated to be worth more than $8 billion. JP Morgan Chase, a prestigious investment-bank that's the flagship firm of its kind for Rockefeller family interests, advised the Port Authority, another body long influenced by banker and builder David Rockefeller, his age then 85, in the negotiations.\n\nThe lead partner and spokesperson for the winning bidders, Larry Silverstein, age 70, already controlled more than 8 million square feet of New York City real estate. WTC 7 and the nearby Equitable Building were prime among these prior holdings. Larry Silverstein also owned Runway 69, a nightclub in Queens that was alleged 9 years ago to be laundering money made through sales of Laotian heroin. 4  \n\nIn December 2003, the Port Authority agreed to return all of the $125 million in equity that the consortium headed by Silverstein originally invested to buy the lease on the World Trade Center. The Port Authority rejected a request by the Wall Street Journal to review the transaction. 5   A press report from November 2003 about the same transaction noted that it would allow Silverstein to retain development rights. 6  \n\nThe lease deal didn't close until July 24th, just 6 weeks before the attack. 7  \n\n\nInsurance Payouts\n\nDon Paul also documented the money flows surrounding the loss of Building 7.\n\nIn February of 2002 Silverstein Properties won $861 million from Industrial Risk Insurers to rebuild on the site of WTC 7. Silverstein Properties' estimated investment in WTC 7 was $386 million. So: This building's collapse resulted in a profit of about $500 million. 8  \nThe insurance money flows involved in the destruction of the original six World Trade Center buildings were far greater. Silverstein Properties, the majority owner of WTC 7, also had the majority interest in the original World Trade Center complex. Silverstein hired Willis Group Holdings Ltd. to obtain enough coverage for the complex. Willis undertook \"frenetic\" negotiations to acquire insurance from 25 carriers. The agreements were only temporary contracts when control of the WTC changed hands on July 24. 9  \n\nAfter the attack, Silverstein Properties commenced litigation against its insurers, claiming it was entitled to twice the insurance policies' value because, according to a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, \"the two hijacked airliners that struck the 110-story twin towers Sept. 11 were separate 'occurrences' for insurance purposes, entitling him to collect twice on $3.6 billion of policies.\" This was reported in the Bloomberg News less than one month after the attack. 10  \n\nThe ensuing legal battle between the leaseholders and insurers of the World Trade Center was not about how the 9\/11\/01 attack on the WTC could be considered two attacks, when the WTC was only destroyed once. Rather it seemed to revolve around whether the beneficiaries thought it was one or two \"occurrences.\" The proceedings before U.S. District Judge John S. Martin involved a number of battles over the insurers' discovery rights regarding conversations about this issue between insurance beneficiaries and their lawyers. 11   12  \n\nIn December 2004, a jury ruled in favor of the insurance holders' double claim. 13  \n\n\nA Parable\n\nTo put these events in perspective, imagine that a person leases an expensive house, and immediately takes out an insurance policy covering the entire value of the house and specifically covering bomb attacks. Six weeks later two bombs go off in the house, separated by an hour. The house burns down, and the lessor immediately sues the insurance company to pay him twice the value of the house, and ultimately wins. The lessor also gets the city to dispose of the wreckage, excavate the site, and help him build a new house on the site.\"\n\n\n911research.wtc7.net\/wtc\/background\/owners.html\n\n\n\"Several months before the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9\/11\/2001 the lease of the buildings was made private and bought by Larry Silverstein, an American businessman, owner of Silverstein Properties.\n\nIn an interview for the media he said that he\u2019s been having breakfast and coffee every morning at \u201cWindows On The World\u201d in \u201cWorld Trade Center\u201d, but on September 11, 2001 he happened to have a dermatologist appointment that morning.\n\nSilverstein\u2019s insurance plan happened to cover terrorist attacks \u201cby chance\u201d. When attacks really took place on 9\/11, Silverstein filed a law suit against the insurance company wanting a double payment since there were two planes that crashed in the World Trade Center towers. The court acknowledged his claim therefore Silverstein was paid $4,550,000,000.\n\nLarry Silverstein, the rumored organized crime figure who struck it rich on September 11th, 2001, then used his 9\/11 insurance windfall to seize control of Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower, and to rebuild the condemned-for-asbestos World Trade Center with its Orwellian \u201cFreedom Tower.\u201d\n\nHe also rebuilt World Trade Center 7, the building that he confessed to demolishing, but which did not stop him from grabbing a $700-million-dollar insurance payout for the \u201ctragic loss\u201d of that building due to an alleged \u201cterrorist attack\u201d that made the 47-story WTC-7 fall straight down in 6.5 seconds from a few tiny office fires.\n\nBy grabbing three-quarters-of-a-billion-dollars insurance money on the building he confessed to demolishing himself, Larry Silverstein defined the word \u201cchutzpah\u201d once and for all time.\n\nAnd now, \u201cLucky Larry\u201d wants more skyscrapers.\n\nAccording to Business Week, Silverstein has announced plans to build an 82-story hotel and condominium tower one block north of the World Trade Center. Construction is scheduled to start later this year.\n\nThe Business Week article noted that Silverstein leased the twin towers for 99 years six weeks before they were destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. But the article fails to mention the relevant background:\n\nFor the record, the high-vacancy, antiquated-infrastructure Twin Towers were a huge money-loser for the City of New York, which was under court order to do asbestos abatement. The price tag could have reached the double-digit billions \u2013 far more than the Towers were worth.\"\n\nSource: \n\nhttps:\/\/realitieswatch.com\/larry-silverstein-bought-wtc-months-911-got-4-55-billion-insurance-buildings\/\n\nEdit: P.S.

The way in which they effectively serve as an internet cult is that it is possible for anyone to easily join the cult so long as they have an internet connection and a reddit account and are willing to do exactly what they are told by the SRS moderator hierarchy and the people who control and run the subreddit. The worst thing about Shitredditsays, however, isn't that they have their own shitty subreddit that makes zero sense to the outside world and to those who are sane and don't believe in the views of social justice warriors and radical feminists. The worst thing about SRS is that they and their friends from other like-minded subreddits on reddit - with the cooperation and unspoken support of a few reddit administrators - have managed to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 where a clique of users who are chummy and friendly with each other have managed to take over a very large portion of this website. The users who have turned reddit into Digg 2.0 and who threaten to ruin the site are what I and some others who understand the situation have come to know as and refer to as \"metareddit cancer.\" I have taken it upon myself to go ahead and create the subreddit \/r\/metaredditcancer to act as a watchdog that chronicles everything that this cabal of reddit users are doing to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 and - in particular - to turn the site into a place run by social justice warrior and feminist moderators who tolerate no deviation from their beliefs in the numerous subreddits that they have come to control as moderators. \n\n>My hope is that after reading this comment of mine that you will subscribe to \/r\/metaredditcancer so that you can stay well-informed about a very serious situation that has arisen - largely unknown to most users - on this website so that we can all gain a greater understanding of what a powerful cabal of agenda-driven users are doing to and have done to this site that we all love. I am a long-time user on reddit who has intimate and in-depth knowledge of this cabal and who has modded multiple subreddits both large and small, who has been intimately involved in discussion with this cabal of users regarding their control of reddit, who knows what their agenda is and what they want to do with their power and control, who has sat in their private discussions in internet chat rooms, who has seen leaks from their private subreddits, and who has absolutely had enough of what they have done to reddit and of what they will continue to do to this site unless the rest of this site is exposed to who and what they are and what their endgame is. What happened to Digg and what has happened to 4chan very recently is undeniably and positively what is happening to reddit now and what has been happening here since 2012.\n\n>The cabal of users and moderators who I refer to as \"metareddit cancer\" hail from the subreddits Shitredditsays, circlebroke, Braveryjerk, circlejerk, TheBluePill, SubredditDrama, SRDbroke, and Drama. This cabal of users are - for the most part - the moderators of these subreddits and these users also control many other subreddits with thousands and even hundreds of thousands of subscribers. They mod subreddits like \/r\/news, \/r\/politics, \/r\/worldnews, \/r\/Subredditdrama, \/r\/creepyPMs, \/r\/offmychest, \/r\/TIFU, \/r\/explainlikeimfive, \/r\/changemyview, \/r\/LGBT, and numerous other subreddits where they have managed to worm their way into moderator positions over the years and then go on to have total control over the type of discussion that goes on in their subreddits. They make sure that any discussion that goes against their social justice and feminist beliefs is censored and controlled and\/or they mod their subreddits like ban-happy dictators who get rid of anyone who breaks the circlejerk that goes on in their subreddits every week. This is absolutely the case with offmychest, creepyPMs, and Subredditdrama. Maybe the worst example of their way of worming into moderator positions and destroying subreddits is that of \/r\/LGBT and how 2 transsexual radfem SRS trolls - one of which has become infamous on reddit and other chan websites - managed to take control of the subreddit in 2012 and then acted like dictators and abused their power so badly that reddit's administrators had to be called into the drama. The admins refused to remove the two SRS moderators, the LGBT subreddit went into meltdown because of them, and this led to the subreddit being ruined and people having to flock to the newly created \/r\/ainbow subreddit because one of the biggest forums for discussing LGBT issues on the internet was taken over by members of Shitredditsays. This is the first notable time that SRS and other metareddit cancer have taken control of subreddits and they've gone on to manipulate reddit's subreddit request system to bring even more subreddits under their control. They organize subreddit request attempts in private subreddits where they plan out their agenda and they do the same in their internet relay chat rooms as well. I can say with total confidence that there is *no other reddit clique and group operating on this website that looks to take over and control as many subreddits as they can in a clear and indisputable attempt to control the flow of conversation so that conversations in any given subreddit always lean and kowtow to radical feminism and a perverted form of social justice.* NO OTHER GROUP EXISTS that is looking to take over as much of this site as possible. \n\n>One of the more troubling things that I have come to understand having been an intimately involved user of reddit for years, is that some of reddit's current and past administrators support and belong to this cabal of metareddit cancer. An administrator who was fired from reddit two years ago immediately was added as a mod of Shitredditsays as soon as he left his admin role and made clear what some users had already known: he was literally a member of Shitredditsays and as an admin he used his power to carry out SRS's agenda. He routinely ostracized and terminated the accounts of (shadowbanned) people who posted in subreddits that SRS want destroyed and now he sits as a moderator of SRS. This is one of the biggest yet unknown bits of corruption in reddit's history yet you wouldn't know it because the subreddit created as a watchdog for this sort of thing - \/r\/Subredditdrama - was taken over by SRS and reddit metacancer in 2013 and they censor discussion about themselves so that people aren't aware of what is going on. The takeover of SubredditDrama is one of the worst things that has ever happened on this website because of its 150K subscriber size and because the very people who are the problem that I am discussing happen to be in control of SubredditDrama. This is clearly a monumental conflict of interest given that anything nefarious that this group of users do cannot be openly discussed in SubredditDrama without their consent. \n\n>What caused this  cabal to come to be and what is it that unites them in their desire to control the site through moderator power and through cliques? \n\n>- A need for friendship that's lacking in real life. A # of users involved in this cabal are depressed, aren't \"cool\", are LGBT (more difficult to be included socially if you are a member of this group in real life), are social outcasts, or just want to have some internet friends because they spend a lot of time on this site. This last reason differs a bit from the other reasons and is different in that some users - a smaller number - belonging to this cabal get drawn into it without knowing what the agenda is and they simply just want some internet friends. However, they *always* cave to the agenda when it is brought up (perverted feminism and social justice and tightly-controlled, censorship-happy moderation in the cabal's subreddits) and so it doesn't matter that their intentions for joining the cabal were innocent. In the end, they always come around and you can already see how this is cult-like behavior. Anyone who doesn't toe-the-line and go along with the agenda is shunned or cast out. I've spent time talking to one of them who was cast out of one of the cabal's private subreddits after realizing that the nature of the cabal and \"group of friends\" wasn't innocent and that everything revolved around feminism, social justice, and the ego-driven desire to control as many subs as possible. The scary thing about my interaction with this cast-out former member is that the cabal looks to get your name and personal information. They do this through their everyday IRC chats and in Facebook groups where some choose to take friend requests with their real names. Others use new Facebook profiles with their reddit names. This cast-out user used his real account and he knows now that a reason why they send friend invites is so that you think twice about going against them because then they have your personal info and can come after you with threats at home, work, and anywhere else.\n\n>- **What the users in the cabal do to gain entrance is act smug and superior (social justice, feminism, morality policing) to redditors. The cabal acts as their cool kids club that they weren't good enough for in real life.** THAT IS HOW AND WHY THEY ARE FRIENDS AND WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE ANYONE CAN ACT THIS WAY.\n\n>A cabal on Digg is what led to the deterioration of the site and is what led to the migration that saw users flood to reddit. I'll be damned if I watch the same type of behavior from a group of a few dozen users continue to move reddit towards becoming Digg 2.0. 4chan has been thrown into a serious mess like this after Moot gave mod positions to authoritarian mods in the last year who now control the site given his recent abdication as site admin. Let's not let this develop further on reddit because there's a point of no return.\n\n>TL;DR: The SRS cabal controls too much of and is ruining reddit\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR: A few of Reddit's administrators are corrupt and they are covering up a \/r\/Shitredditsays-led cabal of users who are turning reddit into Digg 2.0.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Link to another front page post on \/r\/conspiracy about this situation.](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/2v77za\/user_shadow_banned_after_exposing_power_users_and\/)","About 8 months ago, I told you guys that the ultimate goal of DNA testing companies weren't about making money from the actual tests but to build the most powerful database in the history of mankind.

As the story goes, Lavigne was extremely unhappy with the newfound pressures of fame. One of the major breaking points that led to her decision to kill herself** ***(whether this was a voluntary act or not is debatable)*** **was an incident where she was ambushed by the paparazzi vying to take her picture in the middle of a small cramped environment** ***(supposedly an underground subway)*** **which led her to realize that fame was a trap. She managed to get away unscathed thanks to the help of her bandmate, Evan Taubenfeld, but had been supposedly psychologically scarred by the incident. The story goes that Avril ended up hanging herself while she was in the middle of recording her follow-up album,** ***Under My Skin.***\n\n**Considering that she had ended up being the biggest star of the year when she debuted in 2002, her label was desperate to let the success of her fledgling career continue. It was then that they resorted to the old playbook of replacing Avril Lavigne with an imposter (the way Paul McCartney had been replaced by William Shepherd (stage name Billy Pepper) who was frontman of the band Billy Pepper & The Pepperpots in 1966) in order to continue her legacy. Just as with The Beatles, Avril's music endured a drastic overhaul in order to fit more in the style with of the new impostor so as to make her feel more comfortable playing her new role. Whereas The Beatles music became more complex with the release of 1967's** ***Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club,*** **Avril's music became decidedly more cheerful and immature with the release of 2007's** ***The Best Damn Thing*** **and its lead single** ***Girlfriend.***\n\nAll this information was stumbled upon either by accident, or information was fed to the Avril fanbase from the illuminati (under the pretense of a hoax) from one of her international fansites. In any case, death by hanging always signs of illuminati ritual sacrifice. Robin Williams, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington all died by \"hanging\" as well. \n\nThere are several ways to know this isn't the same Avril Lavigne:\n- First a comparison pic between Avril's typical look from the beginning career to Melissa, the girl who portrays her today: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EsEZNYR.jpg\n\n- Her voice has gotten higher over the years. Never heard of puberty causing a person's voice to turn higher than before. \n\n- **2002:** https:\/\/youtu.be\/2axL4T3R2ak?t=56\n- **2011:** https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YobX6aQFahU *(Even when she attempts to hit the low notes she can't get her voice to go as deep as \"she\" was able to when she was a teenager)*\n\n- \"Avril\" once did a photoshoot around 2007 with the word Melissa written on her hand: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bqV5tv3.jpg\n\n- Her ears are completely different. Ears are like fingerprints, everybody's is unique. http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/w51CnzO.jpg\n\n- Her teeth have caps now. The original Avril has a snagtooth on her left canine which is pretty noticeable. The new Avril does kind of look like she has it but it's drastically reduced and her crowns are always shiny now, indicating that it's not her real teeth.\n\n- Her moles & birthmarks have disappeared: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9oecmUF.jpg\n\n- She never ages anymore. The original Avril had terrible skin with big red pimples breaking out everywhere. This new Avril hasn't aged a day in 10 years and her skin has a synthetic waxy look. On the other hand, here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked with problem skin:\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8AUPvVp.jpg\n\n- And here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked without makeup on circa 2002\/2003: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CWvMfil.jpg\n\n- Her handwriting changed between 2004 - 2006. Her original handwriting: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dtQoVFG.jpg. New handwriting (which has been used since at least her third album onwards): http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r02pls7.jpg\n\n- The original Avril wouldn't be caught dead lipsynching. She used to trash Britney Spears all the time for doing it in 2002. This new Avril lip-synchs all the time and fools her fans into thinking it's live, which is worse than Britney, who lip-synchs but is upfront about it without recording new vocals to fake sounding live. As you can see in this performance, Avril makes a mistake at 02:34 and accidentally says the word \"thinking\" directly into the microphone but no sound comes out.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2uPka1pCSH4\n\n**Once you become familiar with stuff like this, including the \"Paul McCartney Died In 1966\" evidence, it becomes so easy to pinpoint all the signs that indicate an imposter. It's so obvious that all the things people say Avril is a hypocrite for is actually because it's a completely different person playing her now. In fact, nothing about Avril's past history makes sense either. She just so happened to be called up to sing along at a Shania Twain concert, one of her first concerts ever? She just happened to go to California and booked a meeting with LA Reid and got to sing in front of him? Please. These things don't just \"happen\". It seems to me that she was groomed for this from the beginning and replaced when they decided to change her image and mock her fans who bought into it.**","Here is a screengrab: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xxOnnAY.jpg\n\nTheir site is slow, I went through https:\/\/www.comcastroturf.com and just put in some common first+last names.\n\nHere is one for \"Amy Smith\" again using the same content as all 100+ John Smiths used: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0ftwTUr.jpg\n\nThe shit comcast is trying to pull is real and fucking criminal (maybe or maybe not in the legal sense, but certainly in the moral sense).

You can read about the indecent [here](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/19\/17139518\/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-crash-tempe-arizona).\n\nFor context, [Uber announced last year that they planned to buy 24000 autonomous cars from Volvo](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2017\/nov\/20\/uber-volvo-suv-self-driving-future-business-ride-hailing-lyft-waymo). \n\n#Theory\n\nThe tech behind autonomous cars is pretty decent so far, but still in its infancy. [Computer vision is hard](http:\/\/zbigatron.com\/why-is-image-processing-so-hard\/), and still has a long way to go. It will get there. But statistically speaking, rolling out this many autonomous cars at once is a recipe for disaster. I'm not suggesting that Uber did anything malicious like sabotage the vehicle or neglect to ensure that it was properly maintained. But it seems more than likely to me that they must have been aware of the statistical probability of a fatality happening at the scale that they were operating at. Further, I believe this accident will actually benefit them, which only strengthens their motivation to adopt the technology on such a wide scale...\n\n#Motive\n\nI think Uber's motive for adopting autonomous cars is pretty much crystal clear... But aside from the obvious first-mover advantage, and the fact that the liability for this accident will probably fall largely on the manufacturer and not on Uber, the *accident itself* is actually beneficial for Uber.\n\nObviously, the company is losing money in the short run off of this accident. They've temporarily suspended all autonomous operations. And I'm sure there will be lawsuits (even if they aren't found to be 100% liable), etc. But what about long term?\n\nAn accident like this demonstrates that autonomous cars are *dangerous*. And if they're dangerous, maybe we should *regulate* them. Why might Uber want regulations on the autonomous car? Because they know that autonomous cars are an inevitable part of our future, and they want to make it harder for you or I to buy one, or for entrepreneurs to start their own competing fleets, because they want us to use their service - Uber, the ones with the first-mover advantage. \n\nIn an ironic way, this recent accident will ultimately create barriers to entry for Uber's future competitors. Uber doesn't want just anyone to run their own fleet. Just like any other competitive company, they want to own a monopoly. And they'll get it, because they're already the biggest company doing ride sharing with the most lobbying power.\n\n#Proof (Of Motive)\n\nI'm glad you asked. Uber has signed onto a document called [\"Shared Mobility Principles for Sustainable Cities\"](https:\/\/www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org\/). Most of the principals on the list seem benign... but then:\n\n> **10. WE SUPPORT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (AVS) IN DENSE URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE OPERATED ONLY IN SHARED FLEETS.**\n> Due to the transformational potential of autonomous vehicle technology, it is critical that all AVs are part of shared fleets, well-regulated, and zero emission. Shared fleets can provide more affordable access to all, maximize public safety and emissions benefits, ensure that maintenance and software upgrades are managed by professionals, and actualize the promise of reductions in vehicles, parking, and congestion, in line with broader policy trends to reduce the use of personal cars in dense urban areas.\n\n**So basically, they're coming for your cars.** This cannot happen by itself. It requires a regulatory ban on non-fleet self-driving cars in cities. This requires public support. Uber benefits by people fearing autonomous cars, and demanding tight regulations in the name of safety. There are several benefits here:\n\n- You will ultimately be forced to use a ride sharing program to get to work or live your life.\n- The resulting licensing infrastructure will inevitably make it extremely difficult and expensive for competitors to enter the market.\n- Having a monopoly on purchasing cars gives them an enormous amount of buying power that they can use to force manufactures to drop their prices as low as possible.\n- Having a monopoly on car sharing (and cars in general) gives them an enormous amount of selling power that they can use to price gouge consumers.\n\n#Closing Remarks\n\nI believe this is all inevitable. While the accident can be used as a data point to speed up the process of AVS monopolization, all of the economics for this line up perfectly. I could do a whole other post on this explaining step by step how governments will position themselves to revoke your right to own a car, but I won't because I don't want to spam the sub. [Just check out this video if you have 20 minutes and an interest in economics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qh-qutvIqsg). \n\nI want to be clear that I'm not accusing Uber of negligence or homicide. The choice to use autonomous cars may ultimately save more lives long term, and could very well be safer than using human drivers. I respect Uber, and I like their business model. But don't make the mistake of assuming that their intentions are completely genuine. I believe full-heartedly that they have a vested interest in monopolizing the ride sharing industry.\n\n*****\n\n**TLDR Edit:** Allows Uber to push for regulation on autonomous vehicles that would allow them to monopolize ride sharing and prevent consumers from operating their own car.","We've been infiltrated by a concerted effort to hijack this sub and turn it into a battleground of a partisan nature.

If you are not able to hear the interview, I'll break it down into two parts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is the solution to the youth vaping epidemic?\n\n>Age-controlled stores, raising the age from 18 to 21 nation-wide, and a better system of accountability for these age-controlled stores. Sounds pricy to the average retailer, but it is dramatically better than an out-right ban.\n\nRetailers would rather invest in new regulations than to lose their stock. The average retailer (that I've talked to) will buy products (eliquid) for $6-8 on a small scale (i.e. under 1,000 units) to $5 and under, the higher the quantity.\n\nFor this example, we will say the average quantity purchased per flavor is 10. 160 flavors  = 1600 units purchased at a blended average of $6.75 = $10,800. The average retail for e-liquid is $19.99 (even pricier in some areas) giving it a retail value of $31,984. That's a lot for a business to lose and that's just the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Whats a tobacco bond?

The typical tobacco bond lasts 30 years or less and pays interest every year.[\\[1\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tobacco_bond#cite_note-Pro_Publica-1)  \n>  \n>By 2014, tobacco bonds made up $94 billion of the $3.7 trillion [municipal bond market](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Municipal_bond).

In return, the Participating Manufacturers (PMs) agreed to make annual payments in perpetuity to the Settling States, with each state receiving a fixed percentage of the total annual payments. **The amount of the annual payment is dependent on a variety of factors, most importantly inflation and national tobacco consumption.**\n\n\"most importantly inflation and ***national tobacco consumption***\"\n\nWhy do they need the tobacco consumption to grow?

","For those who may not be aware, \/r\/The_donald, \/r\/conspiracy, as well as altright elements of Twitter and 4chan are engaging in a harassment campaign against the teenage survivors of the Parkland school shooting.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.inquisitr.com\/4794782\/one-week-after-florida-school-shooting-4chan-and-reddits-the_donald-launch-campaign-to-smear-student-victims\/ \n\nYesterday, nearly a dozen comments and posts attacking the Parkland school shooter survivors from \/r\/the_donald, \/r\/conspiracy, and other affiliated subreddits were reported to the admins of this site.  Among these threads were a series of users attempting to connect a reddit user to one of the shooting survivors and track down their information.  The survivor in question is 17 years old.  \n\nI was informed that these posts\/comments were all within Reddit\u2019s sitewide rules and that the teenagers were considered public figures open to these types of activities on Reddit.\n\nAs many of you will recall, this approval by the admins for this harassment campaign is wholly different from how they handled a recent highschool \/r\/The_Donald user who posted a selfie of himself wearing a MAGA hat and bragged about turning in a fellow student into ICE. This student had a history of gross instances of racism, homophobia, fantasied about violently attacking immigrants, and constant use of slurs on their account in reference to black people.\n\nScreenshots of this post history are available here - https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/qUR6U\n\nLike the Parkland Shooter victims who are now being harassed on Reddit, this The_Donald\u2019s users information was found on Reddit (where he posted many selfies and identifying information) and a news site picked up the article. \n\nHowever, in this instance the admins found that this T_D user\u2019s information was off-limits and suspended dozens of reddit accounts of users that shared the news article, including temporarily my own.\n\nThere is a clear bias in favor of the altright on this site and this behavior is enabled, if not encouraged, by the administrators.\n\nI urge anyone that reads this to message the admins at \/r\/reddit.com and ask why they are comfortable with this site being the face of a hate campaign against a group of school shooting survivors.\n\nEdit\n\n#Just so we're all clear for comparison Twitter taking action against those harassing the parkland folks saying \"We are actively working on reports of targeted abuse and harassment of a number of survivors of the tragic mass shooting in #Parkland.

It was carried out by a deranged **terrorist** gunman who was using common language and talking points that are often spread on \/r\/The_Donald. **The gunman streamed the full horror of the attack on mosques in New Zealand.** \n\nI will not link to the video because it was so traumatizing that I don't think I will be able to sleep tonight. The gunman uploaded his whole manifesto for the world to read and be further radicalized against Muslims and other minorities as well. It is being spread throughout the internet currently and I am afraid that it is going to lead to more acts against Muslims. I saw it all, and it is the product of the cancer being spread through some communities on 4chan and absolutely on T_D. The only difference for the reddit counterpart is that they resort to dogwhistles in their celebration.\n\nThis is a plea to the people upstairs to SHUT THIS SHIT DOWN NOW. You had the chance to stop this before it resulted in violence. Now you and the rest of the people who run this site are responsible. The evidence is overwhelming and the current dogwhistle being used is [this post that has been made an announcement on T_D joking that \"Islam is a religion of peace.\" It was posted less than an hour after this massacre.](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/b19vyv\/islam_is_a_religion_of_peace_17_year_old_child\/) **The whole comments section of the entire submission is a cesspool of hate and bigotry.** The gunman was literally using the same memes and bigoted statements strewn though that comments section. [Here is a screenshot in case they decide to remove the announcement](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/u5h3clqxl7m21.png)\n\nSomething needs to be done.

Whites will be in the minority. Since 1990, the U.S. Hispanic population has increased by 58 per cent and are now the fastest-growing ethnic population in the United States, increasing almost four times faster than the rest of the population. Thanks to 60 years of postmodern indoctrination in our college campuses and popular entertainment, the pillars of Western Civilization have been knocked down and are swiftly crumbling, including, and most importantly, the holy institution of marriage and family. Currently, the U.S. has a marriage rate of 6.74 per 1,000 people. A Pew Research Center report recently said that one-fourth of millennials are likely to eschew marriage entirely. No marriages mean fewer children which mean less population growth. If you combine the high rate of abortions and divorces, as well as our ageing population, it's not surprising that the Brookings Institution estimated that the U.S. had a fertility rate of 0.62 per cent in 2017-2018, the lowest it's been in 80 years. In 2018, there were more white seniors than children and more white deaths than births. Fertility rates are essential measures of a society\u2019s demographic balance. If they are too high, that can strain resources like housing and education. If they are too low, a country can face challenges replacing its workforce and supporting its older adults, like in Russia, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, declines in rates have not led to drops in the population, in part because they have been largely offset by immigration. Europe faces similar problems of declining population, but we're luckier than they are because their replacement population consists mostly of adherents to a Middle Eastern desert religion that is hostile to Western values. By 2060 it's estimated that Europe, just by sheer numbers, will be an Islamic Caliphate under Sharia law. Luckily, our replacement population will be made up of Hispanics, who share our Western values and ideals. Today, Hispanic immigrants make up a greater share of the Catholic population than of any other religious group; fully one-third of U.S. Catholic adults are Hispanics. The average Hispanic family has 4.0 members, compared to 2.9 members in the average white, non-Hispanic family. The number of Hispanics age 18 and older who are veterans of the U.S. armed forces is 7.3%. The Hispanic population that will be replacing us will be more patriotic and family-friendly than our college-educated white millennials who are currently having difficulties determining what sex they are and possess no loyalty to our country. If America is to maintain our values as a nation, those values will have to come from the Hispanic population. So here's where the border wall comes in. President Trump needs immigration but he wants legal immigration. He wants Hispanics with skills, education, and loyalty to our country. We need strong border security and a big, beautiful wall, otherwise, the illegal population, with their loyalties to Mexico and other Central American countries, will soon sweep across the border and overrun the population of the U.S. and at that point, you might as well tear up our flag, rip up our constitution, and call our country \"Aztlan,\" because it won't be America any longer.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/cbntdy\/i_smell_a_big_fat_commie_rat\/etgxrpd\/\n\n>it's replacement\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/cbkcm3\/asap_rocky_was_being_followed_and_harassed_by_a\/etgtg61\/\n\n>People who vote left are less likely to care about the law or replacement-immigration.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/cblscn\/shocking_map_where_illegal_immigrants_live\/etgnb3u\/\n\n>Population replacement by way of 3rd world migrants in full effect, completely contradicting the global warmm, I mean trillion dollar climate change hustle\/scam and yet here they are talking about the latest sports team win or did you hear what Trump might have done 30 years ago out of context..?

Apparently due to a user-error, the \/r\/news team deleted a thread regarding the Orlando terrorist, but their excuse lacks credibility. \/r\/askreddit had to pick up the thread instead and it became one of their Top of All Time threads. A lot of users became enraged with the censorship from \/r\/news ([1](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/4nqj95\/rnews_mods_lock_and_delete_comments_on_any_thread\/) [2](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/4nr3nm\/temporary_moratorium_on_drama_related_to_the\/)) \n\nThis was when \/r\/uncensorednews became active again and took advantage of the outrage. Back then it looked [very plain and Grey](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3Vh9NA6.png?1) (Worth noting that the timestamps are older than 2016) \n\nA day later, on the 13th they hit the frontpage of Reddit multiple times and became massive. Gaining new moderators, a sidebar, publicmodlog (More on that later), and flooded with brand new posts outraged with \/r\/news. [Now looking like this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XaclzgY.png?1) it quickly became popular and grew while \/r\/news lost their subscribers. [Metric Stats](http:\/\/redditmetrics.com\/r\/uncensorednews).\n\nThe stickied post in the archive above \"About the Modteam and a honest response to where we stand.\" is now deleted. Here it is, notable parts being their promises: \n\n*We will not ever entertain the idea of a safe space.\nIf a comment or submission does not break the rules it will not be removed no matter what.\nAll moderator removal actions will be followed by a comment by the \u201cacting\u201d moderator as to why a removal was made.\nWe will not pander to anyones feelings for any reason ever.*\n\nThe thread was removed due to them failing to keep these promises, scroll down to **Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse** for more on those promises. \n\n[Now this is what their subreddit looks like \\(24\/10\/2017\\)](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gUNgCcK.png). Note the Symbols, more of those later as well. Their more recent history, after 2016, will be featured in the following parts. \n\n---\n###Moderators, their History and Controversy\n---\n\nAs listed above, \/r\/uncensorednews has had a lot of Moderators come by and go. Typically creating drama when they leave. But there's a few which have been steadily active throughout the entire history of the subreddit. \n\nModerators are pretty much what make up a community, they control how it flows, how it works, everything. Reddit has very little protection for users dealing with power-hungry Moderators, but that's a piece for another time maybe. \n\n[Here is the current moderator team](http:\/\/archive.is\/rl0Mv). We'll be discussing only a few of their mods, as well as publicmodlog... \n\n\/u\/RamblingRambo3 -- One of the more controversial Reddit users, even being featured in an article (Already listed above). Rambo has been around for a while, and is unfortunately a self-proclaimed nazi. Them and a few of their friends are the reason for the widespread nazism on \/r\/uncensorednews. I'll be showing you some examples of their nazism in the **Hatred, Racism and Nazism** parts. Alternatively, you may look for yourself. As for any active user in the meta-of-reddit, you'll probably already know about Rambo. \/u\/duckvimes_ did a piece on RamblingRambo **[here](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/TopMindsOfReddit\/comments\/4nttzb\/lets_talk_about_runcensorednews\/)**, give it a read if you wish to learn more about him.\n\n\/u\/The_g0yim_know -- If the name didn't give it away, The_ is also a Nazi. The Goyin Know is a popular nazi catchphrase used for humour and as a dog whistle letting fellow Nazis know when the 'Jewish Elite' have caught on to their content, although they will usually tell you it's a joke. The_ actively posts \"The Siege Culture\", which is is a wordpress\/entertainment channel for Nazis by Nazis. \n\n\/u\/Accipiter_hawk -- One of their newer Moderators, also happens to be a nazi. In a few of their comments they used [Triple Parentheses](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triple_parentheses), which is used by Nazis to point out those who are Jewish... Are you seeing a trend? \n\nI'm not going to go through literally every moderator they've had and have. That'd be a waste of characters, but I'm sure you can guess what the rest have in common with those listed above... \n\n\/u\/publicmodlog -- Public Modlog is a bot, it's exactly what it says, a Public Modlog. Which I feel as if every subreddit should have it, it'd make corruption easier to spot. Or in \/r\/uncensorednews, let us see the censorship inside of the sub. We'll be referring a lot to the bot and it's resources throughout the rest of this thread. I'll be linking images though, but you can view the modlogs for all subreddits with publicmodlog [here](https:\/\/snew.github.io\/r\/). Just put the subreddit name. To view what subs use publicmodlog, visit modlog's profile. \n**Unfortunately the abilities for modlog are somewhat limited, for example; you cannot view Mod Mail between Mods nor can you view Removed\/Deleted content.** When I asked the Moderators to allow me to read the modmail, I got muted swiftly. It's not much of a big deal since it is a security risk bringing a stranger into the moderator team (Even with limited permissions). \n\nIt's also worth nothing that \/r\/uncensorednewsplus does not have Publicmodlog, but instead has all of the moderators. So most likely any corruption that they discuss happens in there. Obviously something private in there, or they forgot. Up to you to decide. \n\n---\n###Content, both Top and Hot\n---\n\nBefore I continue with **Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse**, let's go through the content that's featured on \/r\/uncensorednews. I'm sure you already know what sort of content there is, so feel free to skip this part if you want. \n\nHere are \/r\/uncensorednews Top posts of all time: \n\n1: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/4nqw5e\/50_dead_including_gunman_in_worst_us_mass\/ -- A post spawned from the drama from \/r\/news, which we have already gone over. \n\n2: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/5el4ve\/uspez_ceo_of_reddit_claiming_he_changed_the\/ -- A post regarding the drama caused by \/u\/spez (CEO) [editing comments](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/5frl7p\/spez_makes_an_announcement_on_the_editing_of\/). \n\n3: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/5btdrx\/leaked_documents_reveal_billionaire_george_soros\/ -- A post from PJMedia, [news that is typically false](https:\/\/mediabiasfactcheck.com\/pj-media\/), unfortunately the source they linked in the website doesn't lead anywhere. So I can't confirm if it's true or not, that's up to you to decide concerning their reputation. \n\nAnd here are their recent Hot posts: \n\n1: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/78bix8\/this_instructor_calls_on_black_women_first_and\/ -- A real Story.\n\n2: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/78auug\/uncle_sam_poster_outrages_liberals_dont_apologize\/ -- A story from infowars, which is [literally fake news](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_fake_news_websites). \n\n3: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/789d75\/germany_antifa_accidentally_assault_leftists\/ -- The Daily Stormer is an [official neo-nazi front](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Daily_Stormer), hence the name. \n\nUncensorednews doesn't really feature a lot of real backed up and sourced news. Since the audience for these news sites (With the exception of the Daily Stormer) are quite broad, you'll most likely find some arguments down below in this original thread (First started and posted on \/r\/subredditcancer). So right now, it's moreso just uncensored instead of the news part now that we've went over that. How about we also remove the uncensored part...? \n\n---\n###Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse\n---\nSo without news, at least we still have the uncensored part... Right? \n\n\nBias, Hypocrisy and Abuse: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/5qwr6g\/user_criticizes_breitbart_on_runcensorednews_is\/ -- The Moderators showed bias towards certain news and abused their power, becoming hypocrites. \n\nHypocrisy: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/6esxxa\/the_hypocrisy_displayed_by_runcensorednews_theyre\/\n\nBias, Hypocrisy and Abuse: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/5i78zo\/think_its_fake_news_prove_it_or_youre_banned\/ -- The Moderators show Bias towards certain news and abuse their power, becoming hypocrites. Again. \n\nLet's look at [all recently removed comments ](https:\/\/snew.github.io\/r\/uncensorednews\/about\/log?type=removecomment)(Due to Modlog's limited abilities, we cannot see what the comments featured. But you can probably guess what they said). Here's an [imgur in case they decide to remove the modlogs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vg9XiAb.png?1). There's a lot more than that. \n\n[How about all recently banned users?](https:\/\/snew.github.io\/r\/uncensorednews\/about\/log?type=banuser) [Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B8CgSV4.png?1) \n\n[Bias via approving comments.](https:\/\/snew.github.io\/r\/uncensorednews\/about\/log?type=approvecomment) [Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lqJvUbV.png?1)\n\nPointing out fake news and unreliable sources: \n\n1: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/oNQz9\n\n2: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/FnIyQ\n\nA post from a former \/r\/uncensorednews mod regarding the censorship: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/subredditcancer\/comments\/4tm6p2\/modcancer_in_an_unexpected_spot_uuncensorednews\/\n\nRecent Users banned: \n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/77zx9h\/pittsburgh_is_648_percent_white_and_26_percent\/doq6ej4\/\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/uncensorednews\/comments\/77p32k\/london_now_more_dangerous_than_new_york_city\/dormdmd\/ (Statistics are statistics, racists cherry picking statistics to paint a specifically racist picture is racist.\nEdit: First off, I was just banned from this uncensored sub for 'disruption'. Your living a lie, boys.)\n\nSo there we have it. The Moderators tend to ban and remove any content that they dislike. So without the news part and uncensored part... What do we have? \n\n---\n###Hatred, Racism, Nazism and much more\n---\nAs often mentioned in the articles at the very start of this **Report**, \/r\/uncensorednews is an incredibly toxic place, featuring widespread Racism, Nazism, White Supremacy and just general Hatred towards everything and everyone (Except themselves). Let's begin this massive train. Props if you can read through every single one, probably wise to visit \/r\/eyebleach afterwards though.\n\nRacism from mods:

Used by the Nazis during WW2, mostly for Higher-Ups. \n\n---\n###Sister\/Related Subs\n---\nUncensorednews, much like most of the subreddits from the \"[Moonman_Industries](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Moonman_Industries\/)\", there's a lot of different copies of Uncensorednews under different names. Aside from the name, they're basically identical in every single way, same mods, same everything. \n\nWe've already briefly covered one: \n\n\/r\/uncensorednewsplus -- From what I can gather, this is where the Private Inner-workings of \/r\/uncensorednews operates. Probably to hide away from publicmodlog and discuss their next plans. They've been around and doing this for a while. \n\n\/r\/Moonman_Industries -- Seems to be a Joke Subreddit, but it features the same\/similar moderators. It also features some Neo-Nazi content, nice. \n\n\/r\/redditcensors -- Redditcensors immediately after the [banning of \/r\/altright](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/5ri97o\/raltright_has_been_banned_discuss_this_here\/), a very blatant Nazi-Subreddit that got booted off for doxxing different users. They had Nazi-Flags and swastikas as flairs. \n\n\/r\/europeannationalism -- Another Nazi Subreddit created by Rambo. It features the symbols above. It was extremely inactive until the [banning of \/r\/european](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/4j2bts\/reuropean_has_been_quarantined\/), a Nazi-Alternative to \/r\/europe. It features the Symbols above. \n\n\/r\/thelyingpress -- Another Nazi Subreddit created by Rambo. It features more Nazi Symbols. The only remaining [poster is an automated bot](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/user\/gabout\/overview\/), most likely from Stormfront.  \n\n\/r\/uncensoredopinions -- Basically made as a subreddit for the modteam to deal with the above comments. They gave up shortly afterwards, and it's only occasionally used. \n\n\/r\/traditionalwives\/ -- A White Supremacy subreddit that also features sexism. It's populated entirely by men. No women. Odd that...\n\n\/r\/regroup_central -- A part of the network. No idea what it's used for, completely empty, only Rambo's in it. The Tab-Description is a bit ominous though. \n\n\/r\/AutismGoneWild -- A subreddit which Rambo and his friends acquired. Currently dead, and will most likely be revived when uncensorednews gets the ban. \n\n\/r\/NordicResistance -- Created again by Rambo, he's Finnish. However there's not many Finnish people on Reddit who are also Nazis like he is, so it's dead. \n\n\/r\/sjwhate -- Another Neo-Nazi subreddit, it once had Nazi Symbols, but that's since then been removed (Unfortunately no archives exist). Now it's a SJW-Hate circlejerk subreddit. They're no longer a part of the Network, but have been. Whether or not they still are is unknown, that's up to you to guess. \n\n\/r\/The_Real_Bonhomme -- Unknown purpose.\n\n\/r\/far_right -- Another Nazi Subreddit, featuring more Nazi Flags. \n\n\/r\/actualjournalism -- Unknown if it is a Nazi Sub. Certainly features deliberately misleading content, and the only active poster is a bot that got banned. \n\nI probably missed a lot, they have a tendancy to make as many as they can in hopes that they get lucky (Like with uncensorednews). If you know any, simply message me or comment. Just be sure to mention my username before you do, so I can see it. Moving on...  \n\nFor this section I'll be using 538's Subreddit Algebraic Algorithim (Basically finds things related to one another by searching for keywords, phrases and users. [Here's an article about it.](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following\/)), it's an incredibly useful tool to determine if subreddits are suited to your tastes or contain some nasty content that you wish to avoid. Sometimes subreddits have odd names that seem completely unrelated to their content, and you don't want to be fooled by that, or maybe you do, I don't know. Let's see what Subreddits are similar to \/r\/uncensorednews!\n\n1) \/r\/HillaryForPrison -- A sister subreddit created by the same people who brought you \/r\/The_Donald, or at least worked with TD. The sub's pretty simple, post stuff about Hillary Clinton. Even though she lost ages ago and no longer holds any political power... But whatever helps them cope, I guess. \n\n2) \/r\/undelete -- This used to be one of my favourite subreddits, it shows what posts get deleted\/removed from the frontpage. It's super useful to view what multiple different Moderators are up to. However it's been filled with members from TD, so now it's extremely biased, which isn't very good for what's meant to be an unbiased place for Meta-Reddit discussion. \n\n3) \/r\/conspiracy -- Lots of different opinions are around conspiracy. Some love it, like \/r\/topmindsofreddit, others hate it. It's lately been compromised and has been taken over (Another piece for another time, maybe), view the Mod List to see. Note the times. \n\n4) \/r\/The_Donald -- Without a doubt the largest controversial subreddit throughout the site's history. I've done a few pieces of these guys and just how nasty they can be. You'll find that TD infects itself into literally every subreddit that's dedicated to hate or has hateful content such as the comments featured way above in the train. My other pieces are linked at the very end of this post if you wish to view them. It's a bit concerning though that Trump's largest community has a 66 overlapping similarity score with Nazis... \n\n5) \/r\/WikiLeaks -- It's a subreddit for Wikileaks. \n\n6) \/r\/sjwhate -- Already featured above. The overlap leads me to believe that it's still a part of their network (Which is why I put it above)\n\n7) \/r\/nottheonion -- A default subreddit, and one of my personal favourites. It's everyone's favourite! So I can't fault the members of \/r\/uncensorednews from visiting it. \n\n8) \/r\/AskTrumpSupporters -- Ask Trump Supporters is more so 'Ask Trump Supporters questions that are decidedly suitable', that is to say that the Moderators there hold all questions that are criticising of Trump. Sort of defeats the purpose, but whatever. \n\n9) \/r\/DNCLeaks -- As featured above, the members of \/r\/uncensorednews loves Soros, he's like some sort of attractive flower for them if they were bees. It's a sister-sub of wikileaks. \n\n10) \/r\/worldpolitics -- A default subreddit. One that's constantly filled with anger, frustration and arguing. They're often featured here on \/r\/subredditcancer, even though the Moderators themselves are actually pretty alright. All 90 of them. \n\n---\n###Closing Goodbye and Admin Inaction against Hate Subs\n---\nWell that's all she wrote, or all I wrote in this case. I probably missed a ton of stuff regarding this Nazi-Network, but I think I got all of the important stuff out of the way. If you notice anything missing, simply pm me, comment in this thread or make your own. Go wild. \n\nAs for Admins Inaction, yes the Admins, no one likes the Admins. Not even the Admins like the Admins. But there's no real answer for their inaction against hatesubs such as these. They occasionally step in and fix things up and remove harmful communities. But let's try to be fair to them, they're a tiny team of a few hundred, and need to manage Millions of Users and Subreddits, manage the servers that are constantly straining, update the site and much more. That's a lot of work, and I don't really envy them. From what I've seen from Admin Responses, they prefer to just code and add more things to the site, and avoid site-wide drama. \n\nAnd now you've reached the end. Thanks for reading it all, if you did, I don't think you did. I hope you did, this was a pain to type, all 31268 characters. Well, it's more than that now. **BYE.** \n\n---\nPrevious works ([1](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/subredditcancer\/comments\/6ape77\/documentation_regarding_rthe_donald_using_bots_to\/) [2](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AgainstHateSubreddits\/comments\/72c8yl\/rthe_donald_rtd_td_t_d_is_quite_literally_a_cult\/))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","#Imgur album containing leaked screenshots from the r\/canada mod team: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/7w1q4\n\nOne moderator (Perma) admits to being a white nationalist, and the majority of the r\/canada moderator team are protecting a known Neo-Nazi (Ham_Sandwich77) who uses r\/canada to spread hatred.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. These are guys I empathize with, mostly. They're guys who do face real challenges, and they deserve support. They may be shy, or clinically depressed, or disabled, or somewhere on the autistic spectrum. They may not be conventionally handsome. Often they have histories of severe bullying, or they had dysfunctional family lives. I also do think straight Asian men in America are hurt by racism when it comes to dating. These guys desperately need support, but they're looking for it in one of the worst possible communities on Reddit.\n\n2. The second group can only be called predatory. These are men who not only have lost all hope of improving their own lives, but are also actively trying to drag other men down with them (*redpilling normies* in their slang). They self-ID as \"subhumans\" and encourage others to do so. They actively discourage others from taking steps that might improve their lives, like entering therapy. Worst of all, they hatred of women and \"Chads\" appear normal.\n\nIf MRAs want to do something productive, they should focus their outrage on this, because this sub is uniquely toxic for men's mental health. It's like a zombie apocalypse: The incel \"zombies\" in Group 2 reproduce by infecting men in Group 1. I'm gonna wrap this up with some examples of what I mean.\n\n* [\"Is there anything women hate more than a man with depression?\"](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Incels\/comments\/6f1lny\/is_there_anything_women_hate_more_than_a_man_with\/dierqds\/).

This checklist was written mostly by [Michael Langone](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Langone), a Psychologist who specialised with counseling cultist movements and cult-members in order to make them return to society. Found it interesting, and noticed that TD ticks every single box for a cult-movement. \n\nThere are 15 different Boxes to determine whether a movement is cult-like or not. Let's review by using live examples from \/r\/The_Donald community and the history of the [controversial](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following\/) subreddit. \n\n---\n\n> * The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.\n\n---\n\nTD itself is a safe-space for Trump Supporters to show their support for their President and also to discuss motives and political feelings towards one another. Criticising Trump is a permabannable offence (They prefer to keep that content at \/r\/AskTrumpSupporters or \/r\/AskThe_Donald). If you disagree, then post some comments in TD showing doubt and link them here. You'll get banned since it's against their rules. \n\n---\n\n> * Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.\n\n---\n\nThis blends in with the top comment. \n\n---\n\n> * Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).\n\n---\n\nTD only fit two examples of the practices. One of which are chanting (This goes for all Trump Supporters, MAGA, Lock Her Up, etc~), and the other is denunciation sessions. I'll get a few examples for you...\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/71v8sk\/trump_just_told_everyone_to_boycott_the_nfl_nfl\/\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6zotck\/bungie_removes_literal_kek_armor_from_destiny_2\/\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6z67cr\/jennifer_lawrence_dares_trump_supporters_to\/\n\nUsually when TD-Regulars encounter links such as these, they typically fall back to \"It's just a circlejerk\/joke!\". So I'll be using one of their serious Sister-Subs as a more detailed example which you can browse through yourself; \/r\/TheRightBoycott (Which is moderated and created by TD regulars and is meant to be taken seriously.)\n\n---\n\n> * The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marry, or leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).\n\n---\n\nThis mostly goes towards the Trump Administration itself, which I won't do because it's been done to death. Instead I'll find you some examples of TDers following orders and similarity between lifestyles. \n\nDating: \nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6qss1u\/found_a_guy_on_a_dating_site_he_claimed_reddit\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6hx4u6\/daddd_thats_dads_against_daughters_dating\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/search?q=dating&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all\n\nJobs:\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6w144o\/this_sub_changed_my_life_it_also_taught_me_about\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6uzy58\/i_just_quit_my_job\/\n\nMarriage: \nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/67ig6n\/the_donald_psa_we_all_need_to_be_ambitious_in\/\n\nAs for clothing, Trump enjoys supporters wearing his clothing-outlets and wearing Red Caps. \n\nTrump Supporters tend to believe that Europe is a complete wreck and filled with large amounts of chaos, some parts are (Such as Turkey):\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/71nfvz\/ive_lost_my_fianc%C3%A9_to_the_islamisation_of_europe\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/4bhh3g\/fair_warning_from_europe_vote_trump_or_end_up\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6wzhzo\/safest_countries_in_europe_notice_something\/\n\nChildren: \nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6328i4\/showerthoughts_we_are_now_living_in_a_time_in_the\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/5uokic\/my_wife_and_i_didnt_want_to_have_children_because\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/5cel57\/we_are_overlooking_something_very_significant\/\n\nThe circlejerk-defence doesn't much apply here due to just general thinking; \"Who would circlejerk about kids and leaving their jobs?\"\n\nDoesn't make a lot of sense...\n\n---\n\n> * The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members (for example, the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar or the group and\/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).\n\n---\n\nGod Emperor. \n\nSaving Humanity: \nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/64qjxr\/i_say_this_with_no_exaggeration_or_hype_it_is\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/61jle0\/this_now_hangs_on_my_wall_in_australia_to_pay\/\n\n--\n\n> *  The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.\n\n---\n\nI'm pretty sure I don't need to go into detail on this one.

Often, this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.\n\n---\n\nThis one is more about the Trump Administration. Which I won't be going into as I've stated before. \n\nAs for guilt, due to no criticism or doubts due to the first Box, there's very little posts about this: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6tzn1g\/voted_for_hillary_lifelong_democrat_but_today_i\/\n\n---\n\n> * Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.\n\n---\n\nDrama with Family\/Disowning them:\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/508ozy\/when_you_just_want_to_maga_at_the_atl_rally_but\/\n\nAgain, due to the tight rules regarding positivity, there's very little posts. \n\n---\n\n> * The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.\n\n---\n\nTD mostly recruits new members after terrible terrorist attacks or geopolitical instability and misinformation. Since things are somewhat calm, there's no recruitment processes going on for TD itself. But there are a few other pieces of media that TD is conducting recruits:\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/72ab3v\/fuck_the_nfl_and_fuck_you\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/70rycg\/there_appears_to_be_no_organized_group_for\/\n\n(Both are recent as of making of this post; 25\/09\/2017)\n\n---\n\n> *  The group is preoccupied with making money.\n\n---\n\nCurrently it's not known if the moderators of TD are attempting any scams. However, they have conducted one in the past which resulted in them getting removed from Reddit:\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/535rhv\/milo_yiannopoulos_and_moderators_on_the_donald\/\n\n---\n\n> * Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities.\n\n---\n\nTD loves to spread out throughout Reddit and the internet (This subreddit is actually one of theirs, which is subredditcancer, so that's why there's a high downvote percentage.):\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6iizo7\/post_your_best_liberal_tears_here\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/702qqc\/we_are_being_brigaded_post_things_to_make_them_go\/\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/64sv0t\/i_just_made_a_the_donald_account_on_tumblr_where\/\n\nDue to these posts being old, I can't accurately find the posts which were made from these above threads. When TD decides to have another Post-Content Thread, there's a large post increase during that time period. \n\n---\n\n> * Members are encouraged or required to live and\/or socialize only with other group members.\n\n---\n\nThe majority of TD believe that Reddit is a singular entity that's too big to poke. So instead they prefer to spend their time in their safespace, you can see this for yourself by clicking on the Post History of a few TD-Regulars and seeing what subs they post to. \nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/6qw6vl\/lets_have_a_vote_how_many_of_you_would_not_be\/\n\n---\n\n> * The most loyal members (the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtrue believers\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave (or even consider leaving) the group.\n\n---\n\nThis relates to the box above. \n\n---\n\nSo there you have it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. This thread was first started on \/r\/subredditcancer (Which most likely has a high downvote percentage)\n\nHere is my previous thread regarding The_Donald and their voting habits (Low Quality): https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/subredditcancer\/comments\/6ape77\/documentation_regarding_rthe_donald_using_bots_to\/","All of this is lifted from a subreddit named KiAchatroom.

Basically, he and some other far-right personality are flaming one another over the legitimacy of their nazi credentials. Among other disagreeable things, Auernheimer's opponent has been dissing gamergate and this is pissing Auernheimer off. Auernheimer has this to say about gamergate:    \n\n>the man is talking down to gamergate which is by far the single biggest siren bringing people into the folds of white nationalism. More people have been converted in the past year by things like images of Anita Sarkeesian being rendered as a happy merchant than were in the three before it.     \n\n\n**Andrew Auernheimer** has for long been the(co-) admin of the Daily Stormer and apparently, I quote, \" just about as profilic as a modern day internet neo Nazi propaganda slingers can get.\" I'm a bit surprised I've never heard anyone talking about this before tbqf.    \n\nI don't know enough about internet nazis to put them in some grand top 20 pecking order..but a cursory glance at the rap sheet of this guy does seem to speak of a pretty high profile influencer within the modern day neo nazi circles.   \n\nThere was a KiA thread posted last week about something very similar: a far-right radical expressing delight over the value of gamergate as a recruitment tool.   The original thread has been completely nuked with several posts deleted but the archive is  [OVER HERE](http:\/\/archive.is\/qSeVQ)  for those interested.   \n\n- - -\n  \n\n\nMost interesting bit in the comment section that followed would have to be this post:\n\n>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KotakuInAction\/comments\/9oefz0\/emojigate_steam_moderators_banning_problematic\/\n\u200b\nThe man in question using KiA just 20 days ago under the guise of free speech. weev doesn't actually believe in free speech of course, he is a nazi. \n    \n\n\nTIL Admin of The Daily Stormer has loads of lovingly upvoted posts in KiA that go back at least 3 years.I guess he, too is interested of ethics in video game journalism. Right? I mean, why else would he be there?\n\n\nI would really appreciate other -credible- examples of far-right and Nazis discussing gamergate. If you have any, please share them.   \n\n\n*edit,*  \n\n  \n\nI would guess some of the people at work in KiA are very subtle and covert about it. Some, such as \/u\/TheAltRightIsAlright have always been perfectly  open about what they stand for and usually and consistently get their messages upvoted in KiA. They don't move around preaching about \"needing to solve the Jewish question\" or something. Not quite. Not yet anyway. Instead, it is this subtle gradual seduction. Making sure many of the enemies, jokes and memes are shared.  With occasional utterly obscene lie sneaked in that conveniently never gets called out by anyone. \n\n[Here is a small sample of \/u\/TheAltRightIsAlright  at work in KiA:]\n(https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KotakuInAction\/comments\/90qwtt\/hey_david_there_is_no_silent_majority_do_you_even\/e2t002o\/)\nIn this particular example, he is working a Bernie supporter. \n>Most of the Bernie folks I encountered were completely reasonable and we more or less agreed on about 4\/5 issues.  \n\nI guess if you agree on rainbows, low taxes, kittens and butterflies all being very nice but disagree on whether all the \" wrong\" races should be either murdered or dislocated, we could say that Bernie and Alt-right meet eye to eye 8 times out of 10! If anyone cares to dig through this stuff, you can see for yourself how often this guy gets called out, challenged or downvoted in KiA. He has 26k karma, much of it from KiA. \nThread I'm linking is a good and a bad example: I originally found it via one of the drama subs that have many users who  foolishly rush in to downvote shit they disagree with. As a result, karma in the thread isn't an accurate reflection of how it usually goes. \n\n","Every time the edgelords come up with a new way to be edgy, the white nationalists, alt-right and bigots of the internet cheer with joy.  All reddit needs is the slightest deniability and the free speech warriors and enlightened centrists will vigorously defend any sort of crypto-bigotry.   \n\nTo the average user of reddit there is nothing wrong with engaging in any sort of bigotry or hate speech - but the real crime is when the 'SJWs' call it out for what it is.  \n\nThe fact of the matter always remains, edgelords begin adopting certain memes and phrases simply for the reason that they are associated with white nationalism and the alt-right.  These same people then become up in arms when they get called out for being an integral component in enabling and promoting these dog whistles and the associated bigotry.   What makes this worse is[ the userbase is largely aware](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OPCjbQg.png) that the sub has always been associated with Nazis.  [And there are no surprises when you consider the sort of user base the sub has.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/SLQWxyi.png)\n\nThe sub knows and instructs each other to keep everything 'subtle', which is the entire point of dog whistles.\n\n\n* [Mod instructs users to keep it on the downlow](https:\/\/i.vgy.me\/OvNwxR.jpg)\n* [Fren instructs others to kept the bigotry subtle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JDzCiUJ.png)\n* ['Frens' know to hide their real purpose](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dOvXoSx.png)\n* [Just 'hide your power level'.

One only has to consider what they could possibly mean by 'frens' and 'non-frens'.   Like all ambiguous dog whistles, clowns take on either role as allies or as being 'non-friends'. This is what their baby talk actually stands for: \n\n1. 'frens' are fellow racists, bigots, white supremacists and the alt-right, \n\n2. 'non-frens' who they frequently talk about attacking are marginalized groups, minorities and liberals.\n\nThe more you look at their memes, the more apparent who the 'non-frens' really are.  The baby talk is just that, baby talk designed to normalize the rest of the open bigotry that they promote, by somewhat disarming their hateful agenda.  \n\n\n* [Why do they call us Nazis?

The sub was founded under the guise of \"free speech\", per the FAQ: \n\n> This is a free speech sub. That means it is a place for people to talk about antifa. This may be positive, negative, or neutral. There is no requirement to be an antifa member or support antifa. This means that you have to put on your big snowflake pants and realize that this is a war zone, with people firing off opinions all over the place.  \n\nBut a deeper dive reveals that this is absolutely not the case. This is just another example of a \"left\" sub that is run by hardcore right-wingers that is trying to make their opponent (in this case, Antifa), look bad.  \n\n**There is a lot to cover here, so let's start with the sidebar, the first place to look.** \n\n> \/r\/Antifa: For unbiased news and discussion of the anti-fascist movement \"Antifa\" and related ideas like racism, Islamophobia, transphobia, classism, sexism, elitism, homophobia, determinism, discrimination, consequentialism, individualism, ableism, Black Bloc, communism, anarchism, pegging, deconstruction, relativism, \u221e genders, wealth transfer, LGBT rights, and sexual liberation.  \n\nImmediately, this sub is showing its true colors by linking Antifa to every -ism\/phobia\/social movement that they can think of and disagree with. And note that it does not refer to how someone on the left would view it (e.g. \"anti-racism\") but instead calls \"racism\" a similar view to Antifa. Clearly propaganda. \n\nMoving down to the \"Background\" section of the sub shows an Urbandictionary.com definition of Antifa, [link calling Antifa a terror organization](https:\/\/www.news.com.au\/lifestyle\/real-life\/true-stories\/i-established-a-terror-movement-in-australia-and-i-quit\/news-story\/0e09cb729235d4316809b02bf9e54559), and a link to their horrid FAQ (will tackle this later). \n\nFollowing this is a link to several \"Free Speech Subs\" which in reality are just hate subs:  \nr\/race  \nr\/klan (exactly what you think it is)  \nr\/antifa  \nr\/aztlan  \nr\/eugenics  \nr\/SPLC (a quick view of this sub shows the page filled with articles denouncing the Southern Poverty Law Center)  \n\nAll 6 of these subs were created and\/or run by mayonesa, who is the current head moderator on all of them. This leads me to the next subject. \n\n**The mods are all Neo-Nazi\/conservative mods or have been inactive for several years.**  \n\nLet's take a look through the mods, shall we?  \n  \n**mayonesa:** Head mod of all these subs that has been inactive for several years. Was active in r\/sjwhate and r\/Conservative and a moderator of a bunch of other right-wing subs, including: r\/askaconservative, r\/tea_party, r\/alternative_right, r\/conservativism, and many more.  \n**dvance:** Inactive for 5 years and definitely a nationalist\/alt-righter.  \n**salsaverde:** Inactive for 8 years with a very minimal history.  \n**Octuple:** Inactive for 6 years and definitely an alt-righter.  \n**Occidentalist:** Page does not exist?  \n**diversity_is_racism:** One of the most known alt-right\/racists on Reddit.  \n**computer_world:** Another alt-righter that alos mods r\/new_right and is very active in r\/sjwhate.  \n**warkin:** Alt-righter that mods the same huge lists as above.  \n**genocide_report:** Pure alt-right link spammer with literally zero Reddit comments.  Mods over 200 mostly alt-right subs.  \n**nBob20:** The first moderator that appears different than the above; highly active in the right-wing\/hate strongholds of r\/ShitpoliticsSays, r\/cringeanarachy, r\/subredditcancer, and r\/The_Donald.  \n**TrumpSRB:** A r\/The_Donald regular.  \n\nSo, we have a mod team that is *entirely* right-wing and generally on the excessive (alt-right) side of things. If I had to guess, the mods are all alts of mayonesa (except for nBob20 and TrumpSRB). They all post in the same subreddits and are mods of the same subs: (r\/drones, r\/hipsters, r\/grindcore, r\/death_metal, and literally a hundred more). \n\nMoving on, we've still got a lot more to cover... \n\n**The FAQ**  \n\nThis is another place where they show their true colors. The FAQ pretty much shits on Antifa in a very sarcastic way.  \n\nHere is how r\/antifa describes what Antifa is:  \n\n> antifa was known mostly for shutting down rock venues where bands with un-Leftist opinions were playing, attacking demonstrations where Right-wingers were present, and hanging out in local bars where they would gang up on and beat anyone who had expressed a Right-wing opinion in the bar.  \n> ...  \n> Antifa has always been decentralized, meaning that while its members receive money and propaganda from organizations like the Communist party, this is done entirely informally, and anyone can join in by adopting the symbol and outlook (ideology, lifestyle) of other antifa members. At this point, antifa represents the continuation of the hipster movement, which combined indie rock subculture with the \"social justice\" (SJW) doctrine taught in American public schools. It is a broadly anti-authoritarian movement that also relies heavily on social benefits, so is a libertarian-socialist fusion.  \n\nFurther on, \"Are antifa fascists?\"  \n\n> No, they are Communists, and Communists are authoritarians, which is a term for which most Americans use the term \"fascist\" interchangeably. Fascism was a doctrine that prescribed a type of hyper-modernist, corporatist society which gained a reputation for being oppressive, but in fact was less oppressive than the Communists, as were the National Socialists, who achieved an even worse reputation through allegations of genocide. But it is a mistake to refer to antifa as fascists; if their critics had any brains, and most like most people do not, they would call them Communists, acknowledging the origins of antifa in programs funded by the Soviet Communist Party and its offshoots worldwide (COMINTERN). Calling them \"fascists\" by conservatives is just a variety of DR3.  \n\nIn classic right-wing fashion, they are calling their enemies \"communists\", saying fascism isn't actually that bad, and referring to Nazis as \"National Socialists\". Totally how Antifa members would view the world.  \n\nIt gets worse.  \n\n\"Are antifa wimps\"?  \n\n> After the \"Battle of Berkeley,\" it has become convenient to refer to antifa as wimps. Maybe this is so. However, large groups of relatively wimpy people have taken over societies before and shown themselves to be vicious killers. How strong was Trotsky? Lenin? Stalin?  \n\n\"What should I do if I want to smash antifa?\"  \n\n> Antifa, like SJWs, is a fairly typically expression of Leftist ideas and the corresponding mental states they induce. The only known solution to this is **physical removal**, which ideally would mean exiling all Leftists to Mexico, but others argue for physical removal, which can include Templar activity and lone wolf activity.

Initially, I was not going to expend the effort to try and explain what I suspect is the case but I think at this point it is unavoidable and likely there will be even bigger drama if this problem is not addressed right now. **The problem with \/r\/JusticeServed is that it is being moderated by an authoritarian white supremacist.** He acts as sole ruler of his fiefdom and any other moderator who has the \u201cprivilege\u201d of moderating with him is strictly kept to a servant role. He does not treat his moderator team like they are his equal and worse yet, he does not treat the users that visit and comment in \/r\/JusticeServed like they are his equals as well. [You are a \u201cguest\u201d in \u201chis\u201d subreddit when you participate in \/r\/JusticeServed.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uxNykYq.png)\n\nI was unaware of all of these events until about a little over a month ago since I never really posted in \/r\/JusticeServed I just mostly soaked in all the juicy justice. I was out of the loop until [this post showed up in \/r\/banned](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/banned\/comments\/8zy99w\/banned_from_rjusticeserved_for_hitting_the\/) detailing a high profile ban on \/u\/PlenitudeOpulence who\u2019s [submission](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/JusticeServed\/comments\/8zcqxd\/woman_arrested_after_spray_painting_n_keep_out\/)\n made it to \/r\/All. As we all know, a post making it to \/r\/all gives a subreddit excellent exposure and usually results in an influx of subscribers and new traffic. Any moderator team would be pleased that their subreddit got an influx of users\u2026 not DrDreamtime. As you can see from PlenitudeOpulence\u2019s post, he\/she was banned shortly after hitting \/r\/all. I and other users reading that submission were confused and some more innocent users tried to ask DrDreamtime about why PlenitudeOpulence was banned\u2026 they too were banned for simply asking \u201cwhy\u201d. Suspecting a narcissistic moderator, I decided to sit quietly and observe. At that time, I did not begin to connect the dots behind the ban and his closeted racism. [Please take a look at the title of PlenitudeOpulence\u2019s submission on Justiceserved, this will be relevant later.](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/JusticeServed\/comments\/8zcqxd\/woman_arrested_after_spray_painting_n_keep_out\/)\n\n\nI forgot about the whole thing after a while and continued enjoying \/r\/JusticeServed and its fresh servings of justice. Maybe I was safe because I never really commented much if at all on that subreddit so I never was in the spotlight of the tyrannical mod who thinks he owns that subreddit. Unfortunately, since I forgot that there is a tyrant in charge over there, [I stupidly made a submission with my account on JusticeServed.](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/JusticeServed\/comments\/99nf94\/klansman_gets_4_years_in_prison_for_firing_toward\/) My submission garnered over 10k karma and sat at the top of the subreddit for the whole day\u2026 [and I was banned for it.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ceueefzi25i11.png) **Note again the title of my submission.** \n\n\nDoes anyone see the correlation I am seeing here? [The long list of users, and exmoderators who have been burned by this racist tyrant is getting longer each day.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/50Ahm5H.png) The only correlating factor between the **majority** of these **unjust** bans is that these users do not support Trump and they are not racist or bigoted. My biggest crime was submitting an article celebrating the sweet justice of a KKK leader going to jail. **Apparently DrDreamtime is pro KKK and hates the idea that they went to jail.** Worse yet, I bet he hates that I used \u201chis\u201d subreddit to celebrate his friend getting thrown in prison for being the racist POS he is. So what does he do? He bans me while having a massive temper tantrum at his keyboard.\n\n\nHis actions have fractured the mod team at \/r\/JusticeServed. Though all seems well on the surface of the subreddit; users like u\/OrganicSatisfaction, \/u\/quengilar and \/u\/firesquasher(the former #2 mod of JusticeServed) have spoken up against this tyrant and been effectively banished for no reason other than hurting DrDreamtimes fee fees or [questioning his authority](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PaKjRMMU9HI). The rest of the moderators on his team have figured out the type of invertebrate DrDreamtime is and have effectively shut up for fear of losing their moderator positions. Why? I am not sure. I would not want to help moderate a subreddit where the top mod treated me like I was some slave or lesser than him\u2026 [**Which brings me to the evidence that his own current moderator team has had enough of his antics.**](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/dbzcqrvyt4i11.png)\n\nAs you can see, DrDreamtime is an invertebrate who flexes a little too hard on \u201chis\u201d subreddit. His own moderator team has a problem with his antics, yet they are fearful and powerless to stop him. The screenshot I provided was from a user who got banned and then requested a review and somehow luckily got unbanned by a moderator on JusticeServed who I will not name. Why won\u2019t I name the hero JusticeServed mod who understands what real justice is? Merely because I want to see the fallout that will happen from dropping this information on DrDreamtime\u2019s head. The fact that this screenshot has been shared with the rest of reddit means that likely DrDreamtime will start doubting his moderator team since he likely won\u2019t know who to trust anymore. After all, he likely thought they were all good dogs that he owned, but didn\u2019t realize that human beings have their own opinions and no one can \u201crule\u201d without support. He never treated them like equals and their actions behind the scenes demonstrate that fact.\n\n\nHow did a user with the vertebrae of a jellyfish end up being the top moderator of JusticeServed? God only knows.\n\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n**This part of the writeup is to the moderators of JusticeServed who are not complicit with the unjust moderating being done by our \u201cfavorite\u201d white supremacist DrDreamtime:**\n\nGuys. You and I know what you are up against. I apologize for disclosing that screenshot and putting you guys at risk but complacency breeds corruption. You all are cogs on the wheel to him and he won\u2019t hesitate to purge any of you if he feels threatened in the slightest. Your time as a moderator will only have lasted as long as you lick his boots. He does not participate in debates or conversations. He bans and laughs at other\u2019s inability to bring him to **justice**. You all must bring him to justice or risk being thrown out of your \u201chouse\u201d one by one. He will have likely seen the screenshot I have provided and begun combing through the modlogs to see who **defied him**. Don\u2019t doubt this fact, he is the type of user to comb through the users who frequent his subreddit, he uses the mod toolbox to determine the political stance of a user, and then bans those users he dislikes. Meaning that you guys have only a little time before he comes after you as well. He is meticulous with his hate and his agenda to assert his power over other users on reddit. \n\n[You know what to do.

They outline a long sad tale of abuse on the part of their top moderator and his unwillingness to even communicate or treat them like they exist.

The post has been one of the top posts on the subreddit this week. https:\/\/t.co\/At3c1Ukqko\n\n>In response to the post, other users on the subreddit wrote that they posted the meme & hashtag on Twitter & were then penalized by the platform for \u201cviolating our rules against posting misleading information about voting.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/g3qG90SyNQ\n\n>That violation refers to a rule Twitter imposed in April to, as reported by The Washington Post, \u201cprevent deliberate attempts to misinform voters.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/E4M5OMqcB0 https:\/\/t.co\/lkiYBYGDUk\n\n>Later, the official Twitter account for the subreddit -- which is run by the subreddit's moderators -- tweeted a similar Putin meme & the hashtag. The account said Twitter temporarily suspended the account due to it, & a moderator on the subreddit directly mentioned the tweet. https:\/\/t.co\/O6wN1pIN3B\n\n>Since then, others on the subreddit have pushed the troll campaign, & use of the hashtag on Twitter has picked up dramatically. Some have posted similar memes as were on the subreddit, & some wrote that Twitter penalized them for violating its election misinformation rule. https:\/\/t.co\/Pl2G3B4xal","\/r\/incest - quarantined \n\n\/r\/inbreeding - banned\n\n\/r\/incestexperiences - banned\n\n\/r\/incest_relationships - quarantined","Given how much hate subreddits love to misleadingly parrot statistics out of context to support the racist and bigoted parts of their ideology, I decided to do a [brief analysis](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YxwmyAe.jpg) of one particularly popular [Redditor](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/90JFsBd.jpg) and [the_donald](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kPDRwLS.png) user's work. So I did a break down of Stonetoss and Red Panels, to find out how similar they are, and to find out how hateful their author actually is.\n\n\n[Further comparison of the statistics](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xGSmPXW.jpg) adds more weight to the already overwhelming case that Stonetoss = Red Panels.   It also reveals a Nazi's obsession with their delusional ideas about \"genetic and cultural purity\".  Take for example the topic five reoccurring themes^1 in Stonetoss:\n\n1. [Race \/ Racism](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9BzITrb.jpg): 67 \/ 28.88%\n2. [LGBT](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QloZmJT.jpg):\t44 \/ 18.97%\n3.

The \"right\" has used their opposition to \"identity politics\" as a ***cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre*** \/ wedge issue to silence any attempt to correct injustices.   And yet the entire catalogue of Tosspot's comics are a demonstration of Nazism, or more politically correctly, \"White\" identity politics in action.     \n\n\n\n\n\nLike all hate subreddit users, Tosspot writes off his virulent bigotry as merely being an inherent part of conservative or right wing politics, and they are being oppressed and silenced for \"just\" having \"opinions\".   \n\n\nIt doesn't just show what an utter Nazi Stonetoss is, but it also demonstrates what a coward the average user of a hate sub actually is.   They exclusively attack the most vulnerable groups.     But again like cowards they hide behind claims that they are \"just joking\", when their actually goal is to harass and incite discrimination, hatred and violence against minorities. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n^1 Obviously a comic can be both sexist, homophobic and racist, so comics can contain multiple themes.

In fact, they are all heartless enough to do it [again](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/7uzxfq\/oh_shit\/dtoiq3u\/). About 17 upvotes and about 3 weeks old.

It has about 30 upvotes. Keep in mind, their definition of \u201ccommunists\u201d includes anyone to the left of Ted Cruz. Their definition of \u201cISIS\u201d includes anyone with even a light tan. [Archive link](http:\/\/archive.is\/8pLbx)\n\nYou get the point. These were trivially easy to find. They went unremoved for so long because their community is completely uninterested in reporting violent content and their mods are completely uninterested in removing violent content. This is only a fraction of the \u201chelicopter rides\u201d posts and comments I found, so I know for a fact that some will remain up even if The_Donald\u2019s mods finally remove these. \n\nI strongly suspect that they almost never issue bans for this kind of behavior even when they do remove the post or comment. That makes these kinds of violent posts and comments into a renewable resource. The_Donald violates sitewide rules with zero consequences on their own sub, and that bad behavior spills over onto the rest of Reddit. ","I guess I stirred the hornets nest once again. I made a comment on that u\/spez post in announcements asking when they would address the largest hate propagandist on the site, and within the last hour I've been getting some lovely attention from hate trolls.  \n\n\nHeres the comment chain: [Are you ever going to ban Mayonesa](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/announcements\/comments\/9ld746\/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of\/e763n2f\/?context=3)  \n\n\nHeres the posts popping up attempting to harass me: [I challenge infamous neonazi leader umrkerplunky](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antifa\/comments\/9lfne3\/i_challenge_infamous_neonazi_leader_umrkerplunky\/)  \n\n\nNotice how people Ive blocked for harassing me are already laughing together about how theyve harassed me in the past.

And one thing the Top Minds love to do is to claim that \"they were only trying to trigger people into thinking that they are racists and bigots\" so they can avoid the shame of getting called out for their deplorable behavior.   \n\n\nBut the truth is always the same that the people using white supremacist dog whistles are in fact largely white supremacists, and the rest are simply closet white supremacists or those who are simply happy to enable and promote their cause.    Tosser is case in point.   Like all unabashed white supremacists is certainly not above blatantly **lying** and **claiming** that his **[virulent racism](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/FiLBYgz)** is just \"ironic\".

They'll even claim that the \"alt-right\" aren't really racist, [despite being founded by literal white supremacists](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_B._Spencer).   No matter what the reaction is, the trolls will always claim \"that is what they intended\", and that \"they have won\".  \n\n\nThis once again is another lie, as generally these people are incredibly sensitive when they get called out for being bigots.  So don't let their endless lies distract you.\n\n &nbsp;\n\nLike always Tosser unwittingly exposes the strategy with his poorly illustrated comics:\n\n\n>>>  **Tosser:** [\"Us geniuses triggered people into thinking that we and our memes were racist.\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bmk9Gsi.png)  But it's just our [memes are too smart and complex](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wp3MgIC.png) for them to understand!\n\n>> **Also Tosser:** [\"But but our memes are harmless and don't have any \"hidden meaning\"!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RJS4NEU.png)   Calling us out is a violation of our right to [Free Speech^TM.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/66h5FSb.png)\n\n> **Also Tosser:**  [\"When white supremacists say green](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7H2oPrs.png)  we **do** actually mean it is as a [dog whistle.\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VR08cru.png)   And we definitely **do** use it to [identify ourselves](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MvqNLXY.png).\n\n\n---\n\n &nbsp;\n\nWho is Tosser?

We've seen these trends before in other communities where alt-righters start with softer content like this before it escalates into \"race realism\" or \"just asking questions\".\n\nAll I'm saying is that we should keep an eye out for that sub.","r\/OnGuardForThee is a general Canadian subreddit that bans white nationalists as opposed to promoting them to the mod team, and where humour and satire of any Canadian politician will always be welcomed.\n\nWith a moderator [who is a white nationalist (Perma)](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/eDEK33w.jpg), one who used to [mod an openly alt right subreddit (medym)](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/T43K1ir.png) with a colleague with KKK in their username, and one who [blamed the murder of 10 people on our subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/onguardforthee\/comments\/8etod8\/rcanada_moderator_dittomuch_blames_the_toronto\/) without irony (dittomuch), the r\/canada moderator agenda is an extremely obvious attempt at silencing the criticism of right-wing politicians, and alt right talking points.

It's bound to be a very toxic place with people like that. After making a introduction post on there, i got mixed responses. surprisingly there were more than 0 positive posts! There were 2 that didn't tell me to go end myself on there. But as they thought outside of the hivemind they got more than just a little flak on them.

These intrepid Citizen Journalists and Patriots search for any Qlues that might uncover the countless sex crimes of the Deep State.\n\n[It all started with this Q Drop #1859](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fpYX5xt.jpg).\n\n__________________________\n\nThread #1\n\nFor starters, [here is](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96r7gw\/1859_satan_twitter_account\/) the full thread itself. \n\nThe top comment takes this as proof that Trump is firmly in Christ's Corner.

Other Qommenters agree that Trump has a \"tender heart\" and \"a love for America and the world, and people in generel\". This causes a conflict with one downvoted user who says, [\"I'm not a fan of how Christian oriented this movement is. Good and Evil exist independently of Christianity.

One person suggests they need to go through this account [\"with a fine tooth comb for clues\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96r7gw\/1859_satan_twitter_account\/e42r9dz\/) but another patriot simply CANNOT BARE to look at this parody twitter account:\n\n>\"Sorry - I'll leave that for someone with a stronger stomach than me. I went to the account for just a moment and left because I couldn't stand the sickness and blasphemy. I won't let some of the images I briefly saw there into my life.\"\n\n[In this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96r7gw\/1859_satan_twitter_account\/e42mvom\/), Qusers try to find when this account was created. Some speculate that it was created by @Jack (Twitter's founder), others find it fishy that someone was able to score this username in 2008. Bringing up 2008 removes the fog and makes it all click:\n\n>\"Isn't that when Satan entered the Whitehouse? Why wouldn't the nwo leader, and Satan, be given the handle on the deepstate intercom system?\"\n\n____________________\n\nThread #2\n\n[Full thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96rrgo\/q1859this_twitter_acct_was_referenced_for_a_very\/)\n\nThere's not much drama on this thread. Someone speculates that the user behind S8n might be Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. Another person begs people not to follow the twitter account because then you're literally following Satan which is bad. [I did find this exchange funny](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96rrgo\/q1859this_twitter_acct_was_referenced_for_a_very\/e42qrvt\/). \n\n>\"I tried digging through who S follows only about 35 or so but it is too much of a Evil Horror show for me to continue down!

Johnson from 1966-1968 and Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor from 1977-1981. How does this fit in? His only daughter is Mika Brzezinski, who co-hosts the MSNBC show Morning Joe along with Joe Scarborough. Ah-hah! See how it all just falls into place? Clearly, this proves the Deep State controls the Mainstream Media.\n\nI'd like to note that Zbigniew Brzezinski died on May 26, 2017 at age 89 and (of course) the S8n twitter account hasn't been affected by this.\n\nAccording to one poster, this obviously means [that Mika has taken control of the handle](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96s1q0\/zzzzmissusonpng_was_zbigniew_kazimierz_zbig\/e42th39\/). The rest of the thread is full of assertions that Mr. Brzezinski is a member of the Deep State or New World Order. This is proved by posting [that he didn't like Trump and received an award from the Department of Defense](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96s1q0\/zzzzmissusonpng_was_zbigniew_kazimierz_zbig\/e42s3tb\/). If you have any doubt left in your minds, people who also have been awarded this include George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Steven Spielberg. Deep State BTFO.\n\n_____________________\n\nThread #4\n\n[Full thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96v00r\/theory_is_omarosa_s8nsatan_on_twitter\/)\n\nHere we have even more speculation as to the identity of S8n. This time? None other than OMAROSA!\n\nSome users are convinced that she \"is one of ours\" and \"a pro-Trump psy-op\". Other's say:\n\n>\"They are getting the press to talk about how reckless it is to have a phone in a SCIF because that's what Hillary did repeatedly.\"\n\n______________________\n\nThread #5\n\n[Full thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/)\n\nThis thread here takes a turn for the deranged. A collage is posted with references to pizza, children, Santa Claus, and Trump. [Here](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/4c25pk3sspf11.jpg) is a link to the image.\n\n[Members of the Qult are checking his comments for more pizza references](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/e42ookj\/). I'd like to call **A HUGE FUCKING RED ALARM HERE** as commenters post this exchange:\n\n>\"Good point ... actually , some of Anons could actually track him down and expose who the person is behind the profile . Ofc ... not here , doxxing is not allowed - but somewhere else .\"\n\n>\"Yes somewhere else...\"\n\nThese comments are also upvoted and one was posted by the OP. So, we have confirmation that users in \/r\/GreatAwakening are directly advocating doxxing people, just not on their sub so it doesn't get banned. I will be contacting the admins about all this and I suggest you guys do too.\n\nUsers in the thread are finding various pizza references with Seth Green, Kathy Griffin, and Tom Hanks.\n\nThere is also a comment about the appearance of the pizza in the posted collage: [\"Is that a human pizza? Or is it a normal pizza doctored to look gruesome as if the pizza itself was sacrificed?\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/e42pcts\/). The OP responds to this with his take on it:\n\n>\"Hes mentioning pizza exactly 4 times on the profile since he began posting ... One time would be maybe comically to many ... but 4 times ? Why mention pizza 4 times , about sacrificing ? Its not a pizza - its \"pizza\" ... sick f*ckers , him and everyone else who is contributing to him on his profile .\"\n\nThe guy then comments again with even more lunacy, because of course this whole operation includes ANTIFA.\n\n>\"I have found many various profiles ... including what I think was ANTIFA's profile ( some guy , leftist , not official one ) commenting on one of the posts . Basically , many comments from wannabe \"satanists\" , leftists , transgender and LGBT ... but there are some for which I think are REAL satanists - some comments doesnt feel like a joke , and are pretty disturbing even as a joke .\"\n\nFINALLY, the **actual** user behind the Twitter handle takes to reddit to tell them they're all insane. He posts a comment [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/e4407yz\/). Someone else tries to come forward to defend him and argues against the OP but the mods remove his comments. You can read them undeleted [here](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/e4407yz\/). The OP blames all this on S8n and says he brought it on himself and that \"he doxxed himself\". \n\nAt the bottom of the thread, one downvoted person tries to be a voice of reason and posts this: [This is quite a stretch to me. One of the few times i've been like \"Really Q?\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96ro37\/interesting_satan_twittercoms8n_various_references\/e42r8lh\/). This sparks an argument on whether this is simply just a parody account or not. Further down the chain there is discussion about this being a battle of Good vs Evil and religion.\n\n____________________\n\n###Thread #6\n\n[Full thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/)\n\nThis is one of the biggest sources of drama and it's the thread I'd like to turn the most attention to. The mods of \/r\/GreatAwakening stickied the thread as it is the findings of their \"investigation\" on whether S8n did receive death threats or not. S8n says yes, they conclude he's lying. I believe it proves malice on the part of the Mods and that they are intentionally censuring his rebuttals and proofs of harassment.\n\nThe body of the thread is a post of their exchange with him in private messages. The mod also posts this:\n\n>A person getting death threats is a serious issue so The OP submission was taken down along with relevent comments. Besides being a rule violation, Personl safty and preservation of life was the main concern. This required a full investigation so that we can find the individuals behind the threats and take appropriate action.\n\n>I first check the sub and found no threats. I then checked Satan's Twitter account and didn't find any there also.\n\n>I reached out to Satan to get a statement and to gather more evidence to help the investigation.\n\nJust lol at this. I've already found lots of harassment against S8n and even talk of doxxing him on the subreddit. Mods in that thread didn't delete the talk of doxxing but did delete the comments of someone trying to defend S8n. \n\nS8n tells the mods that the harassment he is receiving is coming from Twitter (likely directed to there from sub itself) and posts a twitter link containing screencaps of various threats to murder him. [Here is the twitter link](https:\/\/twitter.com\/travis_view\/status\/1028794649438121984?s=21). The mod then replies to the link with this:\n\n>\"I checked out the Twitter link and there is no evidence of any threats.\n\n>Satan gave statement that no threats came from TGA or Reddit.\n\n>I have given \"Satan\" more than enough time to provide evidence to support his claim. I have check all available sources that might support his claim and found nothing.\n\n>Although I cannot be sure the subreddit user, Satan, is the same person as the s8n Twitter account, I can be sure that the claims of \"death Threats\" are false.\n\n>Making false claims about a crime\/rule violation is just as serious as if the crime\/violation had taken place. This investigation is a good example of that. The mods will address this issue.\"\n\nThis is just a straight up lie. This shows that the mods are being negligent *at best* or are intentionally ignoring his pleas for help. The mod ends the post with this comment: \n\n>\"If you really want to know who Twitter's s8n or satan is here is a link that tells all you need to know\n>Keep in mind that Twitter Satan(s8n) is nobody new. Check out the dates.\n>Anyone that goes by the name Satan should have a good idea about how the public will react.\n>Mess with the bull, get the horn. Time to take your medicine.\"\n\nAnd a link to [this article](http:\/\/observer.com\/2017\/02\/donald-trump-made-twitter-satan-great-again\/) from the Observer. I don't know whether I should even post the article or if it counts as doxxing or not. I'll gladly delete it if the mods tell me to.\n\nAlthough the article is from February 2017 and already public, it includes a trove of personal information about S8n. It includes his age, nationality, first name, his parents occupations, his religious upbringing, his favorite comedian, what type of job he works, the exact date he took his driving test and in what type of vehicle, A FUCKING PICTURE OF HIM, and that he once accepted an offer for a sponsored tweet (i.e. tweeted an advertisement for a company) in exchange for a memory drive for his Mac. \n\nThe bottom of the article includes comments from a prominent Satanist who (rightfully) derides Pizzagate as an embarrassingly idiotic conspiracy theory. This was once intended as a fun behind-the-scenes article on a humorous twitter personality. The fact that the mods are intentionally reposting it on their stickied thread along with their own veiled threats (\"Mess with the bull, get the horn. Time to take your medicine\") and victim blaming (\"Anyone that goes by the name Satan should have a good idea about how the public will react\"), after he begged them for help dealing with death threats and harassment, is nothing less than malicious. It might have already been public, **but there was no reason to bring attention to it once again**, ***especially after he has been targeted for doxxing and harassment***.\n\nJust, Jesus Christ man. These mods are literally insane. Well, now onto the crazy comments - because yes, they can indeed *crank up the crazy*.\n\nThe top comment then tries to claim that none of this was actually about the user behind the handle. [Here is the comment along with another one beneath it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e455swt\/?context=1). The one beneath it scolds people for harassing S8n because\n\n>\"you are giving them the heads up that they are being targeted. It allows them to remove info before the autists can capture it. Sometimes stealth is necessary!\"\n\n[Another commentor](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e459cvn\/?context=1) asks people to look for \"Moloch\" accounts. Beneath that, someone is finally a voice of reason points out: \n\n>\"have you ever tought about.. the mod just gave out Satans information, and he supposedly hadd deathreats etc incoming..\" \n\nto which the mod replies: \"I made it a point not to give out Satan's information, thus using \"Satan\" instead of users name here on Reddit. Thanks for your support.\" as if this somehow absolves him of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe mod also in another comment explains his reasoning [\"My post was simply to let people know that when someone claims \"death threats\", we follow up on it. When I found out that his claims were false I had to point it out being that he placed the blame on Q.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e47lbfi\/). Which, to me, makes this look more and more like an intentional act of malice to spite him \"for blaming Q\". Except that this *really is* all Q's fault. It's just a fucking comedy account, guys. It's not actually controlled by the Devil and the owner isn't a satanist. God damn.\n\nIf you need any further proof that this mod is literally insane, check out this comment\n\n[\"One thing I would like to mention is that anytime Satan is brought into the light. Problems will follow. I had to rewrite this article 5 times because my computer kept crashing and losing all my work. The whole time I could not connect to Reddit. I tried using Windows, and two versions of linux. I was able to make this submission by using a live Kali usb version of linux. It took me 9 hours to submit this. Evil is real. And it is working against us. Believe it.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e44ysze\/). Satan - the Devil himself literally crashed his computer to try to stop him from posting all this. One poster at the bottom of the chain points out that this is literally insane while others defend the mod and call him a shill. The mod back pedals a bit but insists something evil happened with his machine. Some comments were deleted by the mods so [here they are undeleted](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e44ysze\/). \n\nThis Quser praises the mods for their \"great action\" and [\"and finding out \u201cs8n\u201d just wants to spread more lies.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e44yt2m\/).\n\nSome Qult members are now even more convinced *there is something to this after all* because the Observer article the Mods linked to denounces Pizzagate. [Comment here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e450mhh\/).\n\n[This brief chain](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e44zwfj\/) downplays death threats as normal on twitter and that it happens to everyone. A user also replies that these death threats are faked \"to advance the idea that social media needs to be purged on conservatives.\". I will never cease to be amazed by the persecution complex of these people while they gleefully persecute some random twitter personality.\n\nThe man behind the S8n twitter handle himself tries to jump into the thread and posts proof of his harassment but his comments are subsequently deleted by mods. [Here is the chain](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/results_to_investigation_into_subscribers_claim\/e45b85t\/). The mod denies this is proof, posting \"No. that link does not show any death threats anyhow.\" and removes the comment. [Here are the undeleted comments](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/_\/e45b85t\/) which include screenshots and [another](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/972ej0\/_\/e45apkh\/) deleted comment.\n\nI'll post a link to the screenshots S8n posted and a transcript of what they say.\n\n[Screenshot 1](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/ki9ys3)\n>\"you never thought you ll get caught, you sorry ass psycho losers... I ll rape you all in hell for what you did. :d fucking freaks.\"\n\n[Screenshot 2](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/kig1qn)\n>\"@s8n Thats messed up!! So you promote pedophilia!!?? Raping kids??!! Wow okay!!

Clearly it's meant to harass him or draw attention to him. This is the danger I thought would happen from the mods reposting the article. This was entirely their intention by doing that. The admins desperately need to step in and help this man.\n\nS8n once again comes into the thread to try to defend himself and beg them to leave him alone. He tells them to stop sending him death threats and to stop harassing him, and once again, his comments are deleted by the mods. [Here are the undeleted comments](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96u8ph\/satan_twitter_account_is_run_by_a_24_year_old_q\/e43dowj\/). This is a clear pattern of behavior perpetuated by the mods there, over and over again. S8n tries to defend himself, his comments get removed, and other comments advocating harassment or doxxing of him remain standing for the public to see.\n\n___________________\n\nThread #8\n\n[Full thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96uvmw\/leave_me_alone\/)\n\nSo here we are, last thread. S8n takes to \/r\/GreatAwakening making a post begging to be left alone. The mods removed it (how surprising) but [here it is](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/greatawakening\/comments\/96uvmw\/leave_me_alone\/) undeleted. Here is his post in full: \n\n>\"This is s8n and do you realise how insane you all sound thinking I\u2019m nothing more than a parody account that tweets jokes and nothing more. I\u2019ve been doxed, harassed and threatened the whole day because of some \u2018Q\u2019 guy and It\u2019s getting out of hand. You\u2019re all just as bad as the guys you\u2019re trying to \u2018expose\u2019 and I hope you realise that.\"\n\nUsing the same link you can find his removed comments on the thread as well.\n\nI think it's plainly clear to see what the mods are doing. They intentionally ignore any comments that advocate \"investigating\" S8n or links to tools to help do so, while removing and deleting S8n's pleas for help. They are trying to make it appear as if they've done all they can to quell any harassment but in my opinion, I believe they've actually gone as far as directly promoting it and advocating for it. Their attitude of *oh we totally don't approve of any death threats or harassment guys, but by the way, here's a link to a bunch of personal information about him. But remember, harassment is bad!* is pathological and deliberately calculated. It absolutely breaks Reddit's Rules and the entire modlist, as well as the sub, should be banned for allowing the harassment to grow to this scale.\n\n__________________\n\n[Bonus Thread in AgainstHateSubreddits that first documented this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AgainstHateSubreddits\/comments\/97k8a4\/in_a_recent_q_drop_q_references_twitter_user_s8n\/). This is where I got the screenshot pictures and their transcripts, so thanks to the OP there \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nSo in conclusion, \/r\/GreatAwakening has gone even more insane than usual and is purposely trying to doxx and harass an innocent man. I believe all the stuff I've posted here is enough evidence to prove that this is a completely intentional act of malice by the mods there. I implore all the readers here to report this to the admins as I will be doing. You can report it here:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/contact\/\n\nThe more reports they receive, the quicker they are to see it and act on it. If the mods here want me to remove or change anything, just tell me what needs fixing. \ud83d\ude42\n\n**Edit:** Hey guys, small update. I'd like to draw attention to additional harassment that has been pointed out to me. One came in the form of a comment posted on my \/r\/TopMindsOfReddit post. [Link here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TopMindsOfReddit\/comments\/985l9y\/huge_effortpost_ive_documented_the\/e4dnq31\/).

They filled a report that they saw a firearm in my truck... that i didn't threaten anyone, or point it at anyone, that they simple saw it.\n\nI said no, i didn't have a firearm in my truck, and that is not what was seen.\n\nI was then told that due to the nature of the complaint i was being terminated. No questions asked. No investigation . No photos . No security video.\n\nNo proof.\n\nI was then escorted off the property by armed local police right through the main building. To a Lyft driver waiting on me.\n\nAll of my belongings, tools and supplies are still locked in my service truck.\n\nAll because a new guy that has been with the company since Feb. got his feeling hurt because he couldn't get the job he was tasked with completed. So i pulled him off of it and did it myself.

A T.R.O. (Temporary Restraining Order) was issued and the Waldwick Police visited the Harky residence, asking as they always do about weapons in the dwelling. It was then that the footlocker was opened and the magazines were seized along with other property. The T.R.O. was nullified at Family Court in February, at the conclusion of the custody battle, shortly after the seizure incident.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nDuring a subsequent search by Police, a shotgun stored in his attic, his Marine dress sword and 10 assorted collector knives were seized along with (2) standard capacity 30-round magazines the Marines issued to him that he forgot were stowed away in his footlocker. Harky doesn't own a rifle OR the ammo for the magazines. They're just punched-out pieces of metal that contain a spring, a follower and some sand dust.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nFast forward to September 19th's consent order from the Family Court awarding 50% custody to each parent of the couple's 8 year old son, a heart transplant patient. The consent order stated he needed to apply for & pass a background check for a NJFPID card in order to get his shotgun, sword & knives returned. In going through the seized items in September, Waldwick PD then found the (2) 30-round standard issue magazines for the Marine's M-4 duty rifle that he doesn't have, at which time he was placed under arrest & spent two days in Bergen County Jail!  \n>  \n> [https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnjfo\/posts\/1350452708468129](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnjfo\/posts\/1350452708468129) \n\n[https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=10156874946723693&set=a.171729618692&type=3&theater](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=10156874946723693&set=a.171729618692&type=3&theater)\n\nRegardless of whether this guy was technically in violation of state law, as a historian and a lawyer-in-training, this absolutely pisses me off.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with this country?","I know many in this sub are on the right side of politics and mostly Americans. But here I am a leftist European who got a change of mind about gun politics. So a while ago I was against \"normal\" citizens owning guns, I never saw guns as something bad and always was interested in gun history and technology but I always thought that only law enforcement and the military should carry guns. But a while ago a certain incident changed my mind. So about a year ago my family was severely threatened by neo-nazis.  And while they threatened to kill me and my parents because of our political views the police did nearly nothing \"because nothing serious happened\". These nazis often observed our house and actually stood in front of our door with several guys. So basically we felt pretty helpless and we knew if these nazis wanted to get in our house and if they decide that they want to do us harm they are able to do it and are finished before the police arrives. The worst thing is that the only \"weapon\" in the house is my hunting knife and some kitchen knives, nothing you could fend of 10 buffed up neo-nazis. And that\u2019s where I changed my mind because I felt terribly helpless because I know the police just can\u2019t help us. And with a gun in the house I wouldn\u2019t have so many sleepless nights. Nothing big, just a pistol but enough to overpower an attacker much bigger and much stronger than you. I think I know why so many Americans don\u2019t want to give up their guns. A bad guy or a criminal will always get their illegal gun to commit crime. The legal guns are for the righteous citizens to defend themselves from these bad guys.","Beto was never meant to win. Beto was placed where he is to make red flag laws and gun registration look like much lesser violations of our rights. This is the classic bait and switch. Beto looks like a left wing psycho so that someone else can swoop in and say \"well that guy is nuts, how bout just some red flag laws to keep us safe, we don't want your guns.\" They're going after the moderate vote.","some of you may have seen the old version of this on other subs...\n\nI\u2019ve Been promising to update and revise this for a LONG time... and include sources for the numbers....\n\nSo here she is.\n\nDo with it what you will:\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\n**The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America**\n\n\n\nThere are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1) \n\n\n\nU.S. population 328 million as of January 2018.  (2)\n\n\n\nDo the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. \n\n\n\nStatistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.\n\n\nWhat is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:\n\n\n\n\u2022 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)\n\n\n\u2022 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)\n\n\n\u2022 489 (2%) are accidental (5)\n\n\n\nSo no, \"gun violence\" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.\n\n\nStill too many? Let's look at location:\n\n\n* 298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)\n\n* 327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)\n\n* 328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)\n\n* 764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)\n\n\nThat's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.\n\n\n\nThis leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others\n\n\n\nYes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...\n\n\n\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n\n* 70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)\n\n* 49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)\n\n* 37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)\n\n\n\nNow it gets interesting:\n\n\n* 250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)\n\n\n\nYou are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!\n\n\n\n* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)\n\n\n\nEven a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). \n\n\n\nA 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.\n\n\n\nSimple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!\n\n\n\nWe don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014sources\u2014\u2014\n\n\n1. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/nvsr\/nvsr64\/nvsr64_02.pdf\n\n\n2. https:\/\/everytownresearch.org\/firearm-suicide\/\n\n\n3. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/nhamcs\/web_tables\/2015_ed_web_tables.pdf\n\n\n4. https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/national\/police-shootings-2017\/?tid=a_inl_manual\n\n\n5. https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/nation\/la-na-accidental-gun-deaths-20180101-story.html\n\n\n6. https:\/\/247wallst.com\/special-report\/2018\/11\/13\/cities-with-the-most-gun-violence\/ (stats halved as reported statistics cover 2 years, single year statistics not found)\n\n\n7. https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/related-topics\/trends-statistics\/overdose-death-rates\n\n\n8. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/flu\/about\/burden\/faq.htm\n\n\n9. https:\/\/crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov\/Api\/Public\/ViewPublication\/812603\n\n\n10. https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/2018\/02\/22\/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html\n\n\n11. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/heartdisease\/facts.htm","Vote Here:  \n[http:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/msnbc\/poll-do-you-think-people-should-be-allowed-carry-guns-public](http:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/msnbc\/poll-do-you-think-people-should-be-allowed-carry-guns-public?fbclid=IwAR0GmBVNbFOhfRqOP0T4yguwkqEWfZbtxi5XMX6hLBFLMVFcePvRjWbZSvI)","Could it be that it turned out that this shooting didn't quite fit the narrative?

This law was specifically to address school shootings and rampage\\\\active shooters in response to the Freising Rampage and Erfurt School Massacre. The new laws included: background check extending into political & foreign affiliation and non-violent offenses, psychological screening, requiring membership in hunting or sport shooting club, testing proficiency, storage & security at home (if allowed), minors handling & training with licensed professionals instead of parents, sport shooters had to be 21 now, sport shooting have to be a member of club for 1 year first, 6 month waiting period in between purchases (maximum 2 at a time). All these shootings have 4 or more victims in one setting, session, incident or incidents without the FBI's \"cooling off period\" in between. And you should all be able to find multiple sources if you Google or Bing them. Many of these are in German so you\u2019ll need to use Google or Bing translate. Hopefully this can aid in correcting the misinformation that Germany is devoid of mass shootings or that the laws they enacted in response to the Erfurt Massacre in 2002 were effective. Feel free to correct any mistakes I've made. Or to let me know of any incidents I've missed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to downloadable doc of all lists mentioned:    [http:\/\/www.filedropper.com\/germanymassshootings-copy2](http:\/\/www.filedropper.com\/germanymassshootings-copy2) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most amazing things I found out were:\n\n\\#1 Germany had only 17 mass shootings in the 16 years before, and then 49 after their 2003 laws.\n\nA 188% INCREASE in mass shooting incidents. \n\nLike Canada, Australia, UK, South Africa, France, and Argentina, Germany rarely had mass shootings before their strict gun laws. Then saw a significant INCREASE after. In each instance they had more mass shootings incidents after implementing strict gun control.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#2 Germany has had 41 mass murders since their **2003 Weapons Act** went into effect, and only had 18 in the 16 years before. \n\nA 128% INCREASE in mass murder incidents. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Most of them are not on Wikipedia\u2019s Massacres pages\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#3 Germany went from having 4 school shootings in the 16 years before , to having 6 school shootings since 2003. \n\nA 50% INCREASE in school shooting incidents.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#4 Like France, when I started searching in German I found exponentially more mass shootings and mass murders. The English speaking media simply does not cover most of these tragedies so it gives the impression that it never happens in Germany or is much more rare than it is.\n\n4A) German media is very different than America, UK, Australia, France, etc\u2026 They go out of their way to not make celebrities of School Shooters, Mass Murderers, Serial Killers, Terrorists, etc\u2026 You don\u2019t see their faces and their names are not published. In fact, there was outrage in Germany when the UK media put the Winnenden School Shooter\u2019s face and name everywhere. \n\n4B) While searching in German, I inadvertently found more mass shootings and mass murders in France. It seems like German and French media often throw shade on one another while portraying their own country as safer and more reasonable. Both cover American tragedies extensively and are very critical of American culture. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#5 I am aware that most of these are not listed in Wikipedia. That\u2019s one of the primary reasons while I started compiling my own lists. In fact, it\u2019s kind of the main point. Gun Control advocates and Neutral curious parties are getting the wrong impression from Wikipedia. Mass shootings and school shootings happen outside the USA much more frequently then the media presents. These things are not unique to America. And are in fact not unique or even rare in the developed world at all. Wikipedia does not list most of these and people should know. No matter what side of the debate you\u2019re on. \n\n5A) Many of these also only have sources in German. Once again that is the point. That there is no English American or even English speaking media coverage of these events. Thus creating the false impression that they don\u2019t happen in Germany. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#6 Also like France there were many gruesome instances of men murdering their entire families. Most of them are triple homicides that don\u2019t rise to the level of mass murder events (4 dead). But many did kill 4 or more people and are included on the Mass Murders list I created. \n\n6A) Unlike France and much like Australia, there wasn\u2019t the occasional female perpetrator. \n\n6B) Often, one family member will be left alive & unharmed. The murders will occur when one sibling or the mother is out or away from home. This is unique compared to other countries. And I can\u2019t imagine how that would effect the surviving sibling or mother.  \n\n6C) Also like France, but unlike Australia, many of Germany\u2019s family killings featured a Middle Aged or Elderly man killing his parents then himself. Those were usually triple murders not included on the mass murders list. \n\n6D) Just like France and Australia, it seems to happen in bunches over the course of a few months to a year. Then goes a way for a couple of years, then happens again. It starts up randomly, then plays out over a few or several months. One after another. There are many articles about it in the German media. There were quite a few Australian articles about it too, and some in the French media. \n\n6E) I can\u2019t help but think of the clusters of school and mass shootings that happen in the USA. One killer commits his heinous act and then shortly after another one follows suit. Then yet another and so on. Mass murder appears as a contagion when you list it in sequential order. In the USA people go into schools and do these things. In Australia, France, and Germany these men go home. A man feels like a failure then takes the life of his wife or ex wife and children. Then kills himself most of the time. Is it just like when a young man in USA feels like a failure then goes into his school or ex-school and takes the lives of his classmates? Then kills himself with Death by Cop. It seems remarkably similar. Are the schools of America the equivalent sacred safe space that the family home is in Germany, Australia, or France? In the minds of Schizophrenics or Psychotics, does being a failure as a father & provider in Germany equate to being a high school reject in America? Does Germany provide an effective support system for mentally unstable teenagers and young men that then ceases when they become adults in the work force? Perhaps causing  them to act out much later than struggling American teenagers and young adults.","Because that's the ultimate goal here. Full Stop.\n\nReduce the amount of gun owners until they are voted out, then pass actual gun control. \n\nThey are in it for the long con folks.","Because \"[gun violence](https:\/\/www.westernjournal.com\/university-virginia-cancels-traditional-veterans-day-21-gun-salute-gun-violence-concerns).\" What a despicable asshole.","It's either the guns fault or the persons fault but either way we should be measuring by who\/what is responsible.","The EU has instructed our government to adopt the forthcoming tightening of arms legislation.\n\n\nWe do not belong to the EU but have special treaties (Schengen-Dublin, and other) which they want to cancel if we do not adopt them.\n\nSwitzerland has a long shooting tradition and many active sport shooters.\n\n\nIf the people vote \"YES\" on 19. May, we will become California 2.0 or worse.\n\nWish us luck...","This comparison needs to stop happening.\n\nIt's a problem on both ends of the debate as well.\n\n[We're not really number eleven as seen here if you actually look at the year to year statistics instead of the mean.](https:\/\/fee.org\/media\/32882\/annual_death_rate_mass_shootingsjpg.jpg?width=444&height=513) Year to year statistics matter a lot more in a comparison like this one. Norway is on top of that list because of a single incident and because of a huge population difference.\n\nIt's data manipulation and not a good faith argument.\n\nI can already hear people typing \"They do it, so why shouldn't we?\"\n\nBecause we don't have to. We just need to make a more accurate and honest comparison and stop letting them get away with it.\n\nWe simply shouldn't be putting up with comparing Norway, France, Germany, or any other European country to the entire US. This is also true of other favorite comparisons such as Japan, Australia, etc...\n\nThe US as an entity, in the context of how it matters to these kinds of statistics, is more like the entirety of Europe than any individual European country.\n\nThe US has far more shootings than Norway. It's a simple fact. However, it's an irrelevant comparison that only implies that the US has some absurd number of shootings compared to the rest of the world if you take it completely out of context and at face value.\n\nIt is far more accurate to compare individual European countries to individual US States such as California or Texas. Because that is a much more accurate equivalent comparison in every metric that matters here.\n\nStates in the US are very much like EU countries. They have their own laws, tax systems, court systems, law enforcement, militaries \\[National Guard\\], Governors, equivalent populations and economies, and even individual cultures. The main difference is that US States aren't independently sovereign.\n\nIt is disingenuous and dishonest to compare the shooting rates of Norway against the shooting rates for the entirety of the US. It would be far more accurate to compare Norway to Maryland or South Carolina rather than the entire US.\n\nLetting them get away with comparing us to individual European countries for these statistics is a bit like comparing the murder rates in Orlando Florida with the murder rates across the entirety of California and claiming it is an equivalent and fair comparison. It needs to stop being treated as a valid comparison at all and no one should be letting anyone trying to make such a comparison get away with it without calling them out on it.\n\nIf you really want to get down to it [this is really the most accurate representation of how it should be looked at, and the total numbers at the bottom are the actual relevant comparison.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nXP5zKk.png)\n\nWell, would you look at that? All of a sudden the US isn't quite so ahead of the world when it comes to gun violence when you make a far more legitimately equivalent comparison.\n\nFunny that.","Apologies of this has been posted before - I searched and couldn't find anything.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thetruthaboutguns.com\/uk-bans-lever-release-action-and-mars-non-semi-auto-rifles\/\n\nFor those of you who don't know, semiauto rifles (except .22 rimfire) have been illegal in the UK for many years.\n\nRelatively recently, so-called 'lever release' and 'MARS action' rifles have become popular.\n\nBoth are non-semiauto rifles based on semiauto platforms (usually AR).\n\nLever release rifles eject the spent case upon firing like a semiauto, but the bolt then stays locked back until the user operates a lever.\n\nMARS actions work in a similar manner, except instead of a lever, the user must pull the trigger to release the bolt, ie. the trigger must be pulled twice per shot.\n\nThe UK government recently decided to ban both of these types of rifle.\n\nThere was some discussion in the months leading up to this decision about whether it would be lever releases or MARS actions that would be banned. They eventually decided to ban both.\n\nThis was not due to any criminal misuse of these guns, they were essentially just banned on a whim.\n\nBecause all of these rifles are registered to their owners, there's nothing they can do except turn them in when ordered to do so.\n\nI put this here as a warning to all American gun owners. This is the inevitable result of registration.","Due to a new push for civilian disarmament in my state, I decided to do something I've never done before: Personally meet with my state representative to discuss the issues. While getting prepared for this meeting, I found essentially no useful information online. I even contacted the local grassroots group I am a member of, who's monthly newsletter occasionally contains reports of other member's visits, and got nothing useful. Instead, I was sent a list of decades-worn talking points. I already knew my representative would roll their eyes at these given their firm anti-gun leanings. I am writing about my experience to share what I learned by doing, and to hopefully inspire you to do the same.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1.) We\u2019re being negatively stereotyped due to our own approach, which hurts our cause.\n\n2.) Don\u2019t assume a representative already knows what's going on legislatively, despite their rhetoric. I was shocked by what mine didn\u2019t know.\n\n3.) Despite being firmly anti-gun, my representative was open and receptive to my proposed solutions, but specifically wanted to understand personal impacts.\n\nI started the process by simply emailing my representative. I sent a polite email stating what I wanted to discuss in a few sentences, and requested an in-person meeting. I decided to be brief in my note to save my talking points for face-to-face. I didn't suggest a meeting location because I did not know how this typically works. In my case, her primary office is in the state capital and she does not have an office in her district. The state capital is hours away. Getting a meeting time (for a one hour slot) and location was harder than I expected. We agreed on an initial time and location a month ago. In the month of waiting, the location was changed twice and my rep was trying to change the time and date all the way up to the hour before the meeting. I kept reminding myself to never attribute to malice what is adequately explained by incompetence, but I got the strong feeling she was hoping I wouldn't stick with it -- hoping I'd give up due to the unstable details.\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I first met her in a local coffee shop. Before she even greeted me the first thing out of her mouth was, \"Oh thank god you're not an old white guy. This might actually be useful.\" (I am a white millennial.) I already expected this to be a difficult conversation, but the tone was now set.\n\nThis brings me to the first takeaway. My anti-gun representative held strong stereotypes about who's opposing her legislative efforts. This gets affirmed by the fact that most pro-gun people who meet with her are \"white-haired\" (her words) angry men that just rant. Since I didn't know what I was doing, I thought I was over-preparing going into the meeting. I spent several hours thinking through what I wanted to say, wrote up a three page outline I brought with me, and printed out data to support my points from neutral sources. This turned out to be crucial. She said she usually has to take notes, but this allowed her to discuss with me instead. Furthermore, there were multiple cases where she made it clear, in body language or words, that she did not believe my claims until I showed objective evidence. As an example, she did not believe that there was a legitimate use for suppressors until I explained how I use mine and showed her data that demonstrated (1) suppressors are useful for hearing safety but (2) do not make firearms silent. It also turned out to be useful that I was taking a solutions-based approach. Apparently the ranters say what they don't want, but never say what they do want. This is crucial, because anti-gun folks have no idea what gun owners will accept. They really know nothing about us.\n\nSimilarly, she went into the discussion assuming gun owners oppose UBCs solely out of stubbornness. She was stunned when I told her that I believe UBCs will lead to a registry and that I personally do not trust her or anyone in government with a gun registry. I walked her through my reasoning. I didn't mention history or previous genocides. I merely described a very simple scenario I thought was likely that ended in confiscation of \"assault weapons\" enabled by a registry.\n\nThis leads me to the second takeaway. Information commonly shared in our circles may not be known or discussed at all in theirs. An example that surprised me: My representative was oblivious to a petition against her legislative proposal. This petition has a large number of signatures and has been covered by most local news sources. While digging into this topic, it became clear that she was also not at all aware of competing proposals to her own. This, in spite of the fact that the counter-proposals are well known and discussed by gun rights folks in my state. This could have been very bad because the counter-proposal accomplishes the same objective she has in a way gun rights folks find acceptable! It was a common theme, as also demonstrated in my previous examples, that she was missing a lot of relevant and important information pertaining to the decisions she makes. We need to do a better job of meeting with our representatives and communicating this information in a manner that won't cause our skeptical audience to stop listening.\n\nFinally, and this shouldn\u2019t be a shocker, but she relaxed as the meeting went on and stated a few times that the majority of the criticism she receives comes from obnoxious Internet trolls which do absolutely nothing to help. She was very appreciative that I was being constructive, and genuinely did not seem to expect that. Additionally, she professed frustration that many of the people complaining do not know who their actual representatives are. She was open to what I had to say, and legitimately wanted to hear it. In particular, she was very interested in hearing about how my family and I would be personally impact by her proposals, and not just general talking points she already gets from lobbyists. It turned out to be very helpful to talk about my family, our history with and personal use of firearms, and how that would be negatively and unnecessarily impacted. I hope in my case this did something to break down existing stereotypes that gun owners are unreasonable, unapproachable, and unnecessarily stubborn.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly comfortable or fun throughout, but in the end I am very glad I did it and will do it again. If you're a younger gun owner that is capable of having a calm conversation with someone that disagrees with you, please schedule a meeting with your representative as soon as possible -- especially if they are anti-gun. We are generally not being heard or represented in this fight!","The walkout was at 10am. It wasn't mandatory, but the school staff knew nothing about it. It was supposed to be 17 minutes dedicated to the 17 victims of parkland.\n\nIt was not.\n\nIn the front of the school there was an old lady with a crudly drawn AR 15 with an X through it. I've never seen her on school property, and LEOs were dragging her away from students.\n\nAround back there was a group of students, around 20-40, were all standing around, talking and giggling. I walked out and around back, about 10 minutes into the walk out. I had my Don't Tread on Me flag, wearing it like a cape to stand out. I also had my friend with me, with a DTOM flag aswell.\n\nI walk to the group of students, get on a small grass hill, slightly above the crowd. I announced My friend and I are pro gun, and I wanted a conversation about it. I noticed a few LEOs coming up from behind, ready to possibly control us all.\n\nIt's silent for just under a minute, before a student comes forward, and asked about why I don't want gun control, like strengthend background checks, ban on semi-autos, etc. I responded that nearly all firearms are semiauto, and that banning all semi autos would strip hundreds of millions of law abiding citizen of their firearms.\n\nShe immediately changes to the founding fathers could have never been able to predict the guns we have now. I interrupted her, something I regret, and said that the founding fathers could have never predicted cell phones and the postal service. I got called out by someone else in the crowd, to my embarrassment.\n\nShe brought up Australia and Europe, before a staff member there said the 17 minutes were up and to go back inside.\n\nWalking back in, my principal taps me on the shoulder and thanks me for coming out and standing up for my beliefs. I thank her for allowing me to speak freely. She tells me she hunts, though she does not say what she hunts or how she hunts.\n\nBack inside about 20 minutes later there is a total shitstorm on Twitter and Snapchat, saying I was disrupting a moment of silence. Let it be known that it was not a moment of silence, but just a social gathering and free browny points.

But many people throughout the rest of the day came to my defense and saying, quote, \"you have balls of steel.\"\n\nI forgot to mention I am from Massachusetts, specifically Western mass.\n\nThanks again for the kind words and encouragement.\n\nEdit 2: [here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/WSAgu) is a map of the event. Sorry for MS paint, I dont know photoshop.\n\nEdit 3: thanks for my first gold! ","The truth is, I say a lot of things in anger online that I could never bring myself to do, or would even actually want to see done, in the real world. I just really can't imagine killing anyone outside of a self-defense situation, and even the idea that it (meaning a self-defense situation) could happen horrifies me.  \nI really don't want to ever be put in a situation where I have to kill someone, even to prevent myself or kids from literally fucking dying.  \nMy half-brother was murdered when I was 9 years old. He was shot in his bedroom 7 times on his knees begging for his life. To clarify, he lived in a foster home because of complications from his being a full blown schizophrenic by age 12, so I was nowhere near the act of murder. My family was informed roughly 12 hours after. My parents learned the brutal details in the courtroom. I learned the details when I was 16 or 17. Being 9, I imagined he was shot once or twice while sleeping. I didn't know people could be cruel enough to brutalize a mental 6-year-old before murdering them. I had just learned that people would murder a schizophrenic teenager in the first place.\nI know first-hand the consequences of gun violence. I could never willingly do that to anyone.  \nSeeing as my half-brother was severely mentally ill, I'm also very well aware of the shortcomings of the mental health system. It was those shortcomings that led to his being placed in foster care and eventually murdered by gang-bangers.  \nI am not going to trust the same system that got my half-brother murdered with the dispensation of the single-most important right we have. Nowhere else in the world protects our right to bear arms the way we do. That is worth preserving, and my family has paid the blood price for that right already, both in service to the nation, and in the loss some people would blame on our liberty to own firearms.  \nThe shooter was 14.  \nThis happened in California.  \nAlready, a ridiculous amount of gun laws, and did it help? Fuck no.  \nWould a red flag law have helped? Again, fuck no.  \nDelinquent teens aren't targeted for red flags because you have to be a known (ie-legal) gun owner to get flagged.  \nPeople who are goaded or coerced into giving their gun to someone else in the heat of a moment won't get red flagged.  \nGuns will still get into the hands of the people who would use them for evil.  \nOnce you acknowledge that, it is plain that the only goal of red flag laws is in easing the confiscation of firearms without due process into our legal system by masquerading as a fix for the intersection of guns and mental health issues.  \nIt does nothing but open a door for tyrants.  \n\nAnd yes, I get mad when people talk about taking my rights, and then people say, \"YoU'rE sO mAd AbOuT pEoPlE wAnTiNg To TaKe YoUr GuNs, YoU sHoUlDn'T oWn GuNs!\"  \nFuck that and fuck you.  \nNot to mention that we have leftists in media openly tweeting about \"eradicating toxic whiteness,\" (ie-white people), and having those two messages on blast at the same time, knowing full well that whites are stereotypically and generally portrayed as the only gun owners ever, does not encourage any sort of constructive dialogue, even if there was a mutually beneficial dialogue to be had about red flag laws (there isn't).  \n  \nYou want to reduce gun violence, and mass shootings by crazies in particular?  \nMandatory open carry.  \nIf you can be forced to buy health insurance, why couldn't you be forced to buy and carry a firearm? The latter is far less expensive and onerous than the former. The yearly penalty \"tax\" for declining to carry wouldn't even need to be in the triple digits (except for any states that would seek to interfere with implementation).  \nYes, gun deaths will spike initially, but every great change has its birthing pangs, and it will be a massive benefit in many ways. There's an old quote about an armed society and politeness, I'm sure you've heard it.  \nWhen you reframe it in your mind as crowd-sourced policing, it suddenly becomes a downright bipartisan solution that can incidentally curb problems of police brutality on top of the mass shooting problem. There's no way Eric Garner would have been choked to death if there was a crowd of armed onlookers. We can't trust the police to police themselves, right?  \nThat is what I call a beneficial compromise.  \n  \nPeople need to stop this utopian thinking that laws, cops, and tax dollars are going to solve all these problems. People need to engage in their communities, their self-defense, and their own fucking lives (but *that* is another conversation entirely).  \n  \n**EDIT** (20 hours after posting): Thank you all for your input and your condolences. I've read every single one of your comments and responded where people have sought to address my points directly.  \n\nNow, I feel I need to elaborate on my mandatory open carry idea.  \nI absolutely believe that people who don't want to carry or own firearms should have that right. I only propose a federal mandatory open carry law to protect the people who want to open carry in restrictive states like CA, NY, etc. That is, further, why I propose a token penalty \"tax\" for non-compliance that (I believe) should be less than $100 a year, and I only propose the penalty \"tax\" because of the precedent set by the \"Affordable\" Care Act's individual mandate.  \nI opted to propose mandatory open carry over concealed carry, because I feel that concealed carry might cultivate an environment of fear borne of uncertainty (imagine a non-gun owner walking in public and wondering who around them has a gun), and I feel it to be more beneficial to the general ease of mind if everyone's cards are on the table, as it were.  \nThere are obviously kinks and angles that need to be worked out, and I would love to continue hearing your input on the matter.  \n  \nFurther, I want to say that I didn't share that story for pity's sake. Don't mistake me, I absolutely appreciate the expressions of condolence, but I shared that story because I feel that we, gun owners and 2A supporters, are too often seen as cold people who would rather see thousands of kids die in a hail of bullets than give an inch on our rights.  \nI don't fight against new gun regulations because I don't care about those killed by firearms, but because I know that new gun regulations will not help, and will very likely hinder the cause of reducing gun violence, which may very well be a (more cynical) point of new gun laws to continue the erosion of our rights by arguing that whatever new laws came before, \"Don't do enough.\"  \nIf a federal red flag law goes into effect, there will still be another shooting, and another call for action. There will always be some \"loophole,\" \"gap,\" or \"weakness,\" in some gun law or another to be \"fixed\" with more regulation.  \n  \nMore personally, I shared my story because I have been a toxic asshole in many dialogues because I failed to engage those who disagree from a place of open honesty. I hold many pains and fears where guns, laws, mental health, and the mixture of the three are concerned, and rather than having a truly open dialogue, I channeled those pains and fears into horrid personal attacks and general attacks on individuals and groups for their ideologies and my perceptions of their ideologies. I have allowed myself to view fellow Americans as domestic enemies, and while some of them very well may be, as Americans, we have a responsibility to engage each other with civility in meaningful dialogue. Even though I have said otherwise many times, I do not believe the solution to our problems of discourse on this issue (and others) to be civil war or extermination.  \nSocial media forces us to put on fronts, for various reasons. You can't be too open, or you may end up doxxing yourself. If you are too vulnerable, share a personally sensitive subject, or the like, you put yourself at the mercy of trolls who will say vicious and hurtful things that, even though being from a \"faceless\" stranger on the other end of the internet who knows virtually nothing about your life, can still have an impact, especially if such comments are numerous.  \nWe need to act like real humans to each other. Rather than saying stuff like, \"Fuck you, you're wrong, here are the stats to prove it you fucking retard,\" (which has largely been my way, thus far) we need to share our human stories. Those are what people understand.  \nCrying parents. Flowers on graves. Bodies draped in blankets on the streets. Broken windows in a Vegas hotel. Those are the human stories and images that define the gun control debate right now.  \nBut there are so many more stories than that. A rape stopped. A robber detained by an armed bystander. A murder prevented. A woman who sleeps easier knowing help is an arm's reach away. And more, so many more.  \nWe've all read the defensive gun use statistics. For every story of a gun doing harm, there are literally between 10-and-1000 stories of guns saving the day.  \nIf we could all just share our stories, we could fundamentally change the dialogue around firearms.  \nWe can't keep allowing ourselves to be painted as paranoid fanatics lying in wait to strike out at the government or political enemies.  \nThat's not who we are, and each and every one of us can show that as long as we're willing to be open, even, maybe especially, when it leaves us open and vulnerable. We cannot reduce ourselves to vilifying our fellow Americans, even if some of them may vilify us.  \n  \nFuck, that edit was longer than I thought it would be, and it can sound a bit touchy-feely at times, but, if you've read this far (I really appreciate it) I hope you understand what I'm trying to convey, and I hope that you found it to be worthwhile.  \n  \nGod bless each and every one of you.","[Obviously not news to any of us here.](https:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12269048) Here's the part I want you all to focus on:\n\n>And in that lies a real fault. The gun buyback will not prevent such an event happening again. Because, as has been laid out for all to see, the people adhering to the gun buyback aren't terrorists, vigilantes, or mass murders.

The FBI was worried that she was going to attempt another Columbine shooting on the 20th anniversary. When she arrived in CO on Monday, April 15, she legally purchased a shotgun a couple miles from Columbine High School; she then went into the mountains the same day. \n\nThe FBI started a manhunt for her. It was reported that she was spotted in the mountains running naked with a shotgun through the forest and that's how the FBI found her. She allegedly committed suicide when the forest was surrounded by the FBI. \n\nHere is the real story: \nhttps:\/\/www.denverpost.com\/2019\/04\/19\/sol-pais-manhunt-mount-evans-suicide\/\n\nSol Paid was a severely depressed teenage girl. She was \"obsessed\" with Columbine in the same way that emo\/goth kids are obsessed with suicide and death. She wanted to commit suicide. She traveled to Colorado because she wanted to see the snow. She did not run through the forest naked. She didn't even know that there was a manhunt for her. In fact, she may have committed suicide in the mountains long before the manhunt even began. \n\nIt is overwhelming likely that she had *zero intention* to go on a mass shooting. \n\nThis changes this story from a near miss to deeply saddening. As a Coloradan, the fact that she just wanted to see the snow really brings it home and makes the entire story of Sol Paid tragic. \n\nImagine a world where everyone treats the desperation and depression of a teenager thinking about committing suicide as a threat to society and are relieved when they actually commit suicide rather than taking mental health particularly of children seriously. We are scared of guns and fear for our children while actively ignoring mental health issues of children that drive them to commit suicide or even a mass shooting.","The authoritarian control freak rag The Trace ran a pearl clutching article about how bad 8m3 7.62x39 ammo is because the racist prick who shot people in El Paso mentioned it in his diary.

(The true baby killers who want to disarm society) Defend2A","So I'm a college student and for my socioeconomic issues class I was tasked with taking the side of supporting traditional private access to firearms, against the gun control side. Forgive me for the novel that is about to follow but I felt it necessary to adequately explain\n\nThe professor is left leaning and selected me because I am pro 2nd A and he chose the other student who is an outspoken proponent of gun control. In preparation for the debate I looked at all the arguments currently out there. I looked at the arguments that private gun possession is guaranteed by the constitution and supported by various writings by the founding fathers. I looked at arguments that we need firearms to protect against a tyrannical government. That we need guns to defend ourselves against criminals. That mass shooters target gun free zones and unarmed targets. That cities with strict gun legislation still had problems with violence. That overall rates of violent crime in Europe and Australia were largely unaffected by gun legislation. And I find them all true...but decided to use none of them. \n\nI came to the conclusion that if I went down that path that at best I could come out even, with neither side proving anything to the other. I knew that my adversary was well prepared with a mountain of statistics and studies from recognized scientific organizations and that she would be posed to throw these in my face. So what did I do? I accepted their argument. \n\nMy opponent went first and presented a colorful array of statistics, her reasoning why AR15s and 30 round mags weren't necessary, how Japan has such tough restrictions and such a low crime rate and how NYC is a shining beacon of how a large city can recover from the grips of gun violence through tough legislation. How bump stocks mimicked fully automatic weapons. \n\nAfter she spent 15 min going over all of this, it was my turn to counter. The first thing I said was, \"I agree with you that this country has a gun violence problem. I'm sure all your statistics are accurate and valid.\" At this point she was very confused to say the least. \n\n\"There were 11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016 and that is ridiculous. I completely agree, we need to fix this issue, but why are we fixated on AR15s, 30 round mags, and bump stocks? There were over 6,000 handgun murders in this country and only 300 committed with rifles, why are we fixated on AR15s? There will be more gun murders committed this year in Chicago than total fatalities of all US mass shootings. Banning AR15s, 30 round mags and bump stocks will do nothing to reduce these numbers, do you not care about these people? The vast majority of gun murders in this country are gang or drug related. Why is that? Is it really because they have access to a steel and polymer machine that launches propellants at high speed? \n\nCould a better answer be its because of a lack of socioeconomic alternatives that force these people to turn to crime? Could anyone of us honestly travel into inner city Chicago and say, \"Don't worry, you still have crippling poverty, a lack of affordable housing, drug trafficking, failing schools, and gang violence but you can't shoot each other anymore, problem solved!\" \n\nNow let's look at those gun violence rates from Japan. I agree, those numbers are low, but do you really think if they started selling unrestricted guns in Japan that Tokyo would have 650 murders next year? I guarantee they would not, because the issue isn't a simple as access to firearms, it's about poverty, inequality, drug crime, gang violence and institutional discrimination against minorities and the poor. \n\nI agree with you that NYC is a great example of a city recovering from the grasp of an urban crime wave, but is it really just due to gun legislation? During the urban crime wave of the 1970s the Bronx was the arson capital of the world. Did the city ban gasoline? Is it still the arson capital of the world? How did they recover from that without restricting access to flammable materials? Could it be that legislation wasn't the only thing to curb this crime wave?\n\nYou paint yourself as an activist but last year there were 650 gun murders in Chicago and you didn't do a damned thing, but now the tragic murder of 17 students has prompted you to action? You're not an activist and you aren't committed to truly reducing gun violence in this country. If you were you'd be focused on the root of the problem, not on an intimate object. \n\nWhat would you say if you took your child to a psychologist because they were violently launching out against you and trying to harm themselves and the psychologist said, \"Don't worry I know how to solve this problem, just hide all your steak knives and he cant murder you, problem solved.\" \n\nLet's end the plague of gun violence, but lets get to the root of the issue and stop focusing on inanimate objects. Lets improve the socioeconomic environment in urban cities overrun with crime, lets end drug trafficking and street gangs. Lets improve these impoverished inner city schools, lets bring jobs back. Lets stop mass shootings by stop over hyping it in the media and treating fatalities like a high score in a video game. As parents lets take responsibility for our parenting and the actions of our children. Put your phone down and get involved. Instead of taking a day off and marching to make yourself feel good, try volunteering to be a mentor for at risk kids. Talk to your children, ask them how their day was, find out who their friends are, don't let an Xbox do your parenting for you. \"\n\n\nHer rebuttal to that was, \"uh....uh....(shuffle through papers)...yeah but those things are really hard.\"\n\nMy counter was, \"So you're only committed to fixing the problem if it has an easy solution?\" \n\nHer response, \"Uh...no I didn't mean that....I...I don't know, I wasn't expecting that argument.\" \n\nShe then turned to look to the professor for help. He just nodded and said, \"That was good, we've had that topic several times and I've not seen it played out that way, good lets move on.\" \n\nMy advice for those of you engaged in these types of debates is to embrace the opposition's points and data and use them to support your own argument. It's okay for us to acknowledge that the US has a crime problem and still keep our firearms. By taking a more radical approach to fixing this problem we become the activists and make them into the ones who aren't committed to a true solution.

Virginia Beach Council member Guy King Tower said after the shooting that it was regrettable that the city needed state approval to take such actions.\" Darn. If only a gun free zone sign had been on the door to the building.","Think about.  They yell and scream as they seize on a moral panic and push for legislation like bans on \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity\" (>10 round) magazines, believing that somehow those measures would work.  Do they not realize that bans on popular things never work in America?  Since the original AWB expired in 2004, AR-15s, other semi-autos, and their accessories have become so popular with enough Americans, that not only would a new, permanent ban not work (it wasn't very effective the first time), but the costs to taxpayers and society at large would - at best - equal those of the laughable Prohibition and the failed War on Drugs.  Blue states would have low compliance (as is the case with the statewide ban and registration requirements in NY and CT), while the governments of red states would outright declare themselves Gun Sanctuaries and refuse cooperation with federal law enforcement.\n\nAnd to think, we've barely begun to mitigate and reverse the failures of Prohibition 2: Drug War Boogaloo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time you get into an argument with a gun controller, call them what they really are: **Arms-Prohibitionists**. Remind them that they are on the verge of repeating (again) one of America's worst legislative failures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nCalling them \"idots\", \"sheep\", \"statists\" etc. is only divisive and adds little.  Calling them \"gun grabbers\", while rather accurate, only lets them feel smug in their thinking that \"Gun nuts are idiots; no one wants to take their guns\", even as they fawn over Australia and push mandatory  buy-backs or seek (at best) to prevent future generations from being able to have them in the first place.\n\nBy rightly calling them Arms-Prohibitionists, we align them with the most radical and failed \"Do SoMeThInG!!!\" movements in American history.  By referring to the modern gun control movement as Prohibition 3.0 and refer to the War on Drugs as Prohibition 2, we further juxtapose their ban proposals against their costly, Conservative counterpart so as to douse their ability to convince others and themselves that they occupy some sort of moral high ground.  Cursed with the true label of \"Arms Prohibition\",  they are made to realize that the true and insurmountable hurdles that prevent the realization of their ambitions and unfounded hopes are not in the cycles of political fortunes, nor in the ever-changing public sentiment, nor in the powers of the big bad boogeyman they make of the NRA - but in the nonpartisan truths of history and the eternal individualistic stubbornness inherent in America that no practical movement can overcome or let alone ignore.","I live in Washington and tonight we put in I-1639.

Usually Ram-Line brand. Remember those? Lol\nThe Tec-9 was the scary \"assault pistol\" of the day. \n\nOnly the \"rich guys\" owned AR-15's. About 90% of them were manufactured by ABC: Armalite\/ Bushmaster\/Colt.  They were out of MY price range. I'd estimate average MSRP around $1000.\nThe AK variants were a little more affordable,  but not nearly as cheap as a $100 SKS that fires the same round. \n\nAbout 8 out of 10 gun owners I knew then were nothing but Fudds. They didn't give two shits about \"them otter-matic assault guns\" being banned. They were perfectly happy with their .30-06 deer rifles, turkey guns and six-shot revolvers. If you owned something other than a bolt\/lever action, you were viewed as a \"crazy militia member\". CCW licenses were considered a \"radical idea\" that some states were trying.\nIn retrospect, those were dark times....\n\nFast-forward to today...\n\nI just got back from the indoor range with my girlfriend. (When we met 5 years ago, she was completely anti-gun). She practiced with her P365, I tried out my new Canik, and then we blew some fireballs out of my AR pistol for shits-n-giggles. I saw two other couples there shooting together. Younger people in their 20's with AR's and the latest tacti-cool gear. A dad with his son about 12 years old.\n\nJudging from the AR's lining the walls of the adjoining gun store, I'd estimate the \"Fudd ratio\" being around 2 out of 10 now. \nIt warms my heart to see how the gun culture has grown and more people are taking responsibility for their own self-defense...\n\nIf you're under the age of, say, 40 - DO NOT take your firearms and freedoms for granted. The anti-gun forces know very well how popular guns have become, and they will double\/triple\/quadruple their efforts to take your rights away. \nBecome active. Remain active. Vote. Harass your Congressmen. Join the NRA. Join GOA. Take non-shooting friends and co-workers to the range. Teach them. Spread the gospel off the Second Amendment. Practice civil disobedience if necessary.  Do not surrender one more inch. \n\nIn the 25 years or so that I've been a dedicated owner, I've seen so much progress. It will be lost if we become comfortable and complacent. Take nothing for granted. \n\n\n","I now have my concealed carry permit, which negates the waiting period in my state. But before I did, and before I purchased my first handgun(1992), I had a gun show trip planned. Since the gun show was out of town a considerable distance away, purchasing a pistol would have meant a trip to the seller's physical location, another hassle. I'm sure the majority of firearms being bought at gun shows are being sold to people who have concealed carry permits. Driving back to Tampa or wherever to pick up a gun three days later would make buying at a show very inconvenient.   \n\n\nSo what did I do? A week before, I went to my local pawn shop and found the cheapest Saturday Night Special I could---an old RG .22 revolver. Pawnbroker told me he didn't think it worked, so he sold it to me for $15. With background check and tax, I was out $20.90. I then took that revolver with me to the gun show and used it as a trade in, which, in Florida, also negated the waiting period. I walked in with a non-functioning RG and walked out with a S&W 686. I used to regularly see tables of el cheapo \"private sale\" SNS type handguns for just that purpose.   \n\n\nFlorida's new Ag Commissioner has mentioned removing the waiting period negation from the CCW permit. What sense does that make? While I think waiting periods are idiocy, forcing one on a person WHO ALREADY OWNS A FIREARM really makes no sense. Same for trading in a firearm.

Suggesting that you will \"seriously look at\"  (Scott 2) a suppressor ban detracts from the real issues of lackluster  public security, rising mental health issues, and a decaying of the  American social fabric, all of which I suspect are leading to increased  incidences of violence like mass shootings. I would, respectfully, like  to remind you, Mr. President, that suppressors are used in a super  minority of crimes across the country and only result in an average  \"30-decibel reduction in sound\" which still puts the noise level of  suppressed gun fire in the \"132 decibel\" range, \"a level the American  Speech-Language-Hearing Association describes as 'painful'\" (Voytko 2).  For comparison, a jackhammer in use on construction sites is around 100  decibels, putting into perspective just how loud firearms, even with a  suppressor attached, still are. In short, suppressed weapons are not  \"silent\", as Hollywood movies portray, but extremely loud. Contrary to  popular belief, suppressors are actually quite a positive addition to  any shooter's collection, for it serves the important function of noise  reduction to prevent hearing loss, all the while assisting new shooters with recoil management and flinch prevention. Therefore, I urge you, Mr.  President, to reconsider the act of banning suppressors. Such an action  flies in the face of both the hard working, pro-gun, Americans who  voted you into office AND those who paid, and continue to pay, the  extremely expensive $200 NFA tax, followed by an unnecessarily long 8-10  month waiting period, to ensure that they can lawfully acquire a  hearing protection accessory; an accessory that might be forcibly  confiscated from them by your administration in the near future.\n\nThank  you for taking the time to read this message, Mr. President, and I  sincerely hope you consider the logical and pragmatic perspective I have  voiced.\n\nSources:\n\n[https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-banning-gun-silencers\/story?id=63502902](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-banning-gun-silencers\/story?id=63502902)\n\n[https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lisettevoytko\/2019\/06\/05\/trump-signals-hell-consider-silencer-ban-heres-why-he-probably-wont\/#57fa181f3eea](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lisettevoytko\/2019\/06\/05\/trump-signals-hell-consider-silencer-ban-heres-why-he-probably-wont\/#57fa181f3eea)","What the fuck.","(I know that only Post-86 MG\u2019s are illegal, but i don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re regulated\/illegal at all.)\n\n\nI\u2019ve been brooding over this for a while and i can\u2019t seem to find any rational, legitimate basis for any of these things, other than the government wanting to swing its big dick around and slowly gain total control of the people. \n\nHow do we go about regaining some of our rights? \u201cShall not be infringed\u201d seems pretty straight forward, but apparently people think it\u2019s open to interpretation.

With this said, I  implore any establishment to remove these 'No firearm' signs and allow  the law abiding citizen with a gun to shop your store, protect his\/hers  life and the lives of those around them.\n\nIt  is clear that in this day and age it is very important to educate and  have some DAMN INTEGRITY when it comes to gun rights. It is such that...\n\nI  WILL TAKE THE PLEDGE THAT NO ESTABLISHMENT OF BUSINESS WILL SEE A  SINGLE CENT FROM ME SO LONG AS THEY HAVE POSTED SIGNS OR TEXT STATING  THAT I, AS A LAW ABIDING GUN OWNER AND CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT HOLDER,  WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE MY 2ND AMENDMENT RIGHT ON THEIR PROPERTY.  IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PURCHASES AT THESE  PLACES OF BUSINESS BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF MY OWN PERSONAL SECURITY  AND SAFETY THAT ONLY A MY FIREARM AND TRAINING CAN AFFORD ME.\n\nI  ALSO WILL MAKE IT A PRACTICE TO CONTACT ANY BUSINESSES I WOULD NORMALLY  GO TO THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO ENTER THEIR ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE I WAS  ARMED PER MY RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND FOLLOWED ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS  REQUIRED BY LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER THEY MADE IT  PERFECTLY CLEAR BECAUSE OF\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (A NO FIRE ARMS SIGN OR  EMPLOYEE ASKING ME TO LEAVE) THUS I TOOK MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. I WILL  MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT I FOLLOW RULES AND LAWS AND THAT BAD GUYS  DONT. I AM NO BAD GUY SO ILL JUST GO ELSE WHERE!\n\nI  also am making this a call to action for ALL GUN OWNERS! Not just  carriers of firearms but people that have even the slightest support of  the right to bear arms. It is our job as such to protect our rights by  any means necessary. This is just a first step to help ensure the 2nd  amendment will still be around so that my son, who is only 1 year of age  now, will be able to have the same rights I enjoy today. As well as  your sons and daughters. We need to take this action because it is a  small sacrifice but one that can be effective is stood by. There are  worse sacrifices to be made should our rights be infringed upon further.  I hope to God that I never need to make that ultimate sacrifice but am  prepared to do so. There is still time to talk and still other action to  be made that does not require us to take up arms. I WANT TO STAY  PEACEFUL! I want people to be educated. I want the rights I have today  to extend to my son someday. Please take the pledge and make this the  first step to preserving our rights for the future generations.\n\nIf anyone thinks of anything to add to this, please comment below and take the pledge.\n\nThank you and God bless America and you all","Remember how the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a challenge to the ridiculous, draconian NYC rule about licensed gun owners taking registered guns out of the city?\n\nWell, it looks to me like the city just dodged that, and so I guess their anti-gun laws won\u2019t get a Supreme Court review after all.\n\nFucking COWARDS.

On the other hand, some scholars point to a radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997). The variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field. The estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys. The former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use. A different issue is whether defensive uses of guns, however numerous or rare they may be, are effective in preventing injury to the gun-wielding crime victim. Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual Suggested Citation:\"Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence.\" Institute of Medicine and . 2013. Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226\/18319. \u00d7 **defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was \u201cused\u201d by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies** (Kleck, 1988; Kleck and DeLone, 1993; Southwick, 2000; Tark and Kleck, 2004).](https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/read\/18319\/chapter\/3#16)\n\n[If we factor in some of the probable over- and underestimates\naffecting the NCVS and K-G 1993 survey, the widely divergent figures\non DGUs draw much closer together. The latest figures from the\nNCVS indicate 108,000 DGUs per annum.40 If this is adjusted for a\n50% under-reporting due to not directly asking for DGUs, this increases\nthe estimate to 216,000. Next, research by Cook and Ludwig\nsuggests that perhaps 16-42% of DGUs involve crimes not covered by\nthe NCVS. 41 Adding in these would raise DGUs to 256,500-373,000.\nSimilarly, using the average of the K-G one-year lower (B) estimate\nand the NSPOF figure gives a starting estimate of 1,810,000. Assuming\na net cognitive over-reporting (telescoping - forgetting) of\n50%,42 reduces the figure to 1,210,000.4 3 These estimates should\ndraw even closer together if other measurement errors could be factored\nin.](https:\/\/scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=6938&context=jclc)\n\nIn reality they've already been doing research on this for several decades. \n\n[Is this really an issue? No, it really isn't, not even slightly. Anyone looking at the actual numbers can conduct their own breakdown to conclude it's a non-issue.](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/If-you-take-gang-violence-out-of-gun-statistics-does-the-USA-gun-homicide-rate-look-similar-to-other-G20-countries)\n\n>There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n\n> * \u2022 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws\n\n> * \u2022 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified\n\n> * \u2022 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons \u2013 gun violence\n\n> * \u2022 3% are accidental discharge deaths\n\n> So technically, \"gun violence\" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\n\n> * \u2022 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n\n> * \u2022 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n\n> * \u2022 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n\n> * \u2022 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\n\n> So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\n\n> This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\n\n[I mean really, what more do people want to be proven wrong about how and why firearms have nothing to do with crime itself. We manufacture more and more firearms every year, yettttttttt, firearm related deaths\/crimes have actually been plummeting. Woops, there goes a narrative.](https:\/\/www.atf.gov\/resource-center\/docs\/undefined\/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017\/download)\n\n\nThis is akin to claim if firearms didn't exist, the number of suicides would decline as well. Unironically, that didn't happen in places like Australia, in fact, the number of suicides continued to climb; firearm related suicides might have declined, but guess what... hangings increased. Oops there goes another narrative\n\n> [Other studies have suggested that the decreased firearm suicide rates in young adults were accompanied by rising suicide rates by other methods at the national and local levels.35 36 Our study also found this trend, especially among males. Similarly, other countries experienced decreases in suicide rates by firearms and increases in suicide rates by hanging over time.37 38 This may be due to substitution of methods (eg, hanging) for firearms, especially after 1996 when the availability of firearms dropped in Australia.](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4120400\/)\n\nI can go on and on and on and on with every single topic they endlessly screech about, pointing out left, right and center how stupid all of these arguments are, but they'll never concede, because to them, the primary objective is simply making themselves feel better.","If you're a felon and are released after time served you still have all your other constitutional rights afforded to you.

I will admit that when I found that out I'd started crying because that shows that even though he struggled with my sexuality because of his religious beliefs that he was more of an amazing man than I knew and that he really did accept me and he wanted to help other gay kids who didn't have the support that I did and that means more to me than anything else I miss him he was an amazing man and I can't help but wonder how many people he helped by just that small act of kindness. every month he would donate money to youth group for gay kids it's amazing.","Just read it on the SCOTUS live blog!

I'll try to respond to all your stories and comments, love you all!","It all started yesterday when I was sitting in my room headphones on watching YouTube. I caught a whiff of something kind of stanky and when I went into the hall to investigate, it had changed from mild stank to downright vile. I deduced that the smell was coming from one of my 3 roommates bedroom. I texted one of my other roommates and after describing the smell he came home to make sure I wasn\u2019t exaggerating about how bad it was. When he discovered how god awful it actually was we decided to spray some air freshener and see if that made it go away. It did not. About 10 minutes later the roommate to whom the stench belonged exited his room, and I shit you not the smell tripled in strength when he opened his door. My other roommates and I decided that we would confront him the next day if the smell was still there. Next morning sure enough the smell is still awful, so we knock on his door to talk to him and he peaks his head out and asks what\u2019s up. We tell him we\u2019re smelling something offensive coming from his room area and ask what\u2019s going on, he responds with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything and I showered a couple days ago\u201d and goes back in his room. We decide that we can\u2019t keep living with this heinous smell and we go the the dorm RA to get him to do something. He walks in and immediately smells the awful aroma permeating our room, he says that this is definitely a problem and somebody higher up will be over in the morning to look in his room. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Roommate has vile smell coming from room and RA smelled it and says someone will be over tomorrow to look in his room and see what\u2019s causing the smell.\n\n\n\nSo the question is, what the holy heck is making this repulsive smell.\n\n\n\nEdit: Alright I\u2019m going to try to sleep because I got shit to do tomorrow, I\u2019ll update in the morning.\n\n\n\nMorning Update: The smell is about the same strength but I think he took a shower while I was asleep. I don\u2019t know what time dorm staff will be here but I will update when they go into his room. In the meantime I\u2019ll do my best to respond to as many people as possible.\n\n\n\nAfternoon Update: Alright y'all we went to the RA to expedite the process of figuring this shit out and she basically played conflict mediator. She had us write up a roommate agreement about maintaining cleanliness in our rooms. So now we're all cleaning our individual rooms and he has his door shut cleaning his. At the end of the conversation the RA asked him if he would be okay with her entering his room and he said that he was capable of finding the smell himself. So many of you have said that it's a body that I cant help but start to believe it.\n\n\n5:35 PM PST: I've enlisted the help of my roommate to help answer all the questions about the specifics of the smell, as there have been a lot of questions. If you want a more thorough description of the smell or chain of events relating to the smell, you can PM u\/Skunkworks150 \n\n\n\n9:00 PM PST: This is gonna piss a lot of you guys off, it definitely pissed me off. We talked to multiple RA's who gave us a really long and bullshit filled talk about how they technically can't enter his room without permission from a certain person who is kind of the head of dorm operations. So Skunkworks and I decided that tomorrow after his exam we're going to face to face talk to the big man in charge and get him to smell the room. It doesn't seem that some of the RA's are taking us very seriously, the exception is the ones that actually smell it. Once people smell it they can tell that something ain't right. So tomorrow if getting the dude with key rights into the room and smelling it doesn't work then Skunkworks and I really have no choice other than call the non emergency police line.\n\n\n\nI would like to say that this has been a very interesting Friday for me and Skunkworks, in fact he's been in his room with 2 cans of monster diligently answering all of your questions . At least all the questions that aren't creepily asking for pictures with a brand new account. You know who you are. There will be more updates tomorrow morning when we have the man with the keys come and experience first hand what we're going through. Goodnight everybody.\n\n\n\n9:44 PM PST: I thought the last update would be all for the rest of the night until the smell evolved. I went to get some water from the living room and when I walked past the room there was a distinct sourness to what was already a god awful smell. Skunkworks can confirm that the smell is undergoing some sort of mutation, this night will be a bad one.\n\n\n\n12:20 PM PST: So we decided that we should at least talk to the roommate to which the smell belongs with a more forceful attitude before bringing out the big guns. We knocked on the door and told him straight up that we wanted to go in and give him one more chance for redemption before we potentially made it a bigger deal than it needed to be. During the conversation we got clarification that he definitely cant smell it, and since many of you suggested that he cant smell at all I asked if he has had a history of not smelling things that other people clearly smell. He said no, so I suggested that maybe a bird or rodent had died in his air vent and asked him if he would let me in to get on a chair and take the vent off. Now I didn't really suspect that there was anything in there but this would provide Skunkworks and I with an opportunity to get a better look at what was going on inside. While I was in there the smell was very intense, and I knew it wasn't from the vent because my head was up there and nothing but clean air was coming out. But to prolong our stay in the room I took the vent off and used my phone flashlight to look around, there was nothing. After putting the vent back on I asked him if there was any way he dropped any kind of food item under his bed or behind his desk and he said he's sure that he didn't but will check since we're making a big deal out of it. I thought that was the end of the conversation so I got ready to call the head of the dorm when he came into the hall and said that he believes that he found the source of the smell and was going to sanitize whatever it was (he didn't specify because we think he might be embarrassed). Now its a matter of waiting and seeing if the smell goes away. I'll update again to confirm whether or not the sanitation worked.\n\n\n\n1:44 PM PST: Skunkworks and I decided that it would be cool to make a discord so we can talk to you guys so here you go https:\/\/discord.gg\/ECh5kSA\n\n\n\n6:10 PM PST: Alright guys this is looking like the grand finale, Skunkworks and I discovered the source of the smell. So after we did some talking with people on the Discord we went to the roommate and had a fairly long conversation with him about how he needed to eradicate the smell, not just try to cover it up by cleaning. We told him that we didn't care what it was we just needed him to tell us what the fudge was going on. He told us that while he was looking for the source of the smell he put his nose inside of one of his snow boots and found that it had a slight odor. Skunkworks said he would take one for the team and sniff the boots in order to determine if it was the same smell, but when the boots were brought into the hallway it was immediately obvious that they were the source no up close sniff required. The smell was just like we described in previous comments and responses. But like 100x worse. It was eye watering and it made me want to gag. He said that he was planning on cleaning the shoes but Skunkworks and I really didn't want the source of the smell to continue to live. We sat him down and after some conversation convinced him to just straight up throw them away. He took them outside and Skunkworks and I assumed that he threw them in the dumpster. We waited a few hours to see if the smell went away and I'm happy to report that it is about 90% gone. There is still some remaining whiffs and the area around his door is still a little putrid but the dorm as a whole smells WAY better.\n\n\nThis has been a wild ride, and I want to thank everybody who tried to help us determine the source of the smell. I know a bunch of you guessed feet or shoes so congrats, if there was a prize you would have won it. To all you sick people that guessed things I wont write here, I'm glad you were all wrong. I think this is officially over, Goodnight.\n\n\n10:31 PM PST: So I wasn't going to update this anymore until by popular demand on the discord, Skunkworks and I made a video about our experience. Enjoy\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Jh3OYguKkcQ&t=1s ","It\u2019s such a weird feeling. Driving to work and sitting in traffic I can see thousands upon thousands of people in their cars. Each going to their own destinations, each with their own motives and reasons. Each car has items in it and things about it that reflect portions of their lives, be it clothes, empty water bottles, a check engine light still on, or a broken headlight. Each item in the car, or quality of the car, has a story behind it. The story may be short and sweet such as the empty water bottles, or the story may be long and full of twists such as the check engine light. Each story behind each item has more people apart of it. The guy who sold the water bottle, or the family at home scared they may be unable to pay the bills because they have to fix the car. \n\nIt seems that I can\u2019t comprehend the amount of *things* in this world.

Like many suburban main streets, retail business has been rough and they've all closed down.\n\nAfter a month of nothingness suddenly 12 (yes a dozen) identical convenience stores pop up. They look the same, they aim for the same floor plan, they sel the same products at the same prices.\n\nThe names are all tiny variations off of each other like <townname MART> or <Market of Townname> and all clearly bought their signs from the same place as the fonts, colors, size, and shapes are identical. These stores see no business that I've ever witnessed yet have large staff numbers and are surviving way longer than the former stores that closed on this street. \n\nWhen I enter one, they all stare at me while I shop. I don't usually get nervous but it feels like they're staring threateningly rather than intently.\n\nThey only accept cash unless you pay some $50. Most of their products are Walmart brand Great Value products being resold for higher prices.\n\nMost of the products are expired food products. I bought bread from one without checking because I was in a rush, and it turned out it was two months expired! Upon returning to show them I found that the entire shelf was expired foods.

My roommate said she heard the same thing last night and I feel pretty freaked out. We\u2019ve received bizarre sticky notes on the door before as well but mostly wrote it off as local scams. It seems like someone knows that girls live there and that bothers me a lot. Right before calling I heard the crying sound again, but softer. It was definitely not natural and did not come from a live baby. Just a two-tone \u201ccry\u201d on loop. I\u2019m not sure if the police will talk to me personally or not, I will post updates if more happens, and thank you for the swift responses\n\nEdit 2 (12:00 am): I\u2019ve had a lot of people saying it could be an animal, and now that I\u2019ve calmed down I\u2019m more willing to believe that than thinking there is some stalker outside my house playing baby recordings. Something about the sound just felt so wrong though. I have lived by coyotes and mountain lions and peacocks and this was just different. It was very bizarre and made me extremely uncomfortable. The police haven\u2019t said anything to me so I\u2019m assuming it all came up clear. I really do hope it is just some wild animal, but I\u2019m going to take extra precautions, like pepper spray and being more cognizant of locking doors, etc. Thank you all again for the input, it seriously calmed me down and helped me feel better. I still probably won\u2019t be sleeping for awhile so I\u2019ll keep responding to the comments. I will also ask my other roommates if they\u2019ve noticed anything similar\n\nEdit 3 (7:55 am): I just woke up and this post has gained a lot of traction. I appreciate all of you giving advice and encouragement. I have read almost all of it and if I continue to hear this noise with consistency I may look into some of the more hi-tech security stuff and, possibly, a gun. At this time, sleeping it off has helped a lot and I don\u2019t feel too worried about it. My roommate did hear the same exact sound, at the same time the night before, and it bothered her as well, so that\u2019s something to think about too. My neighbors are all college students (at least on this particular block) and none of us have kids. I am willing to believe it was a child\u2019s toy or something since people do go for walks here at night. A vast majority of you said it could be an animal\/the beginning of a song. The song is a no, I listened to it and it is not the same at all. The walls are not thin here and I have never heard my neighbors aside from a garage door opening. It could very well be an animal, like a cat, a bird, etc and I am hoping that is the case. I\u2019m aware now that the baby recording thing is an urban myth, but weird shit happens and in the moment you\u2019re not always going to be rational. \n\nTo those of you who were rude and told me to \u201cLay off the drugs\u201d, \u201cYour dumb if you think this lololololol\u201d, and \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not schizophrenic?\u201d: Try to imagine what it\u2019s like to be a woman. I am a victim of domestic violence, I have been stalked and threatened at my job in the past by multiple men, and in general we are taught to be hyper-aware of things like this because they do happen. I don\u2019t do drugs and I don\u2019t have schizophrenia \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t run around scared for my life at every moment either, and I don\u2019t think that anyone is actively trying to hurt me at this time. But you have to be aware that these things happen and people get scared. I\u2019m shocked so many of you are happy to openly mock someone seeking guidance, on a sub call To Afraid To Ask, no less. Have some fucking empathy. To the person who told me I\u2019m not as \u201cspecial\u201d as I think I am, and that no one would ever target me, fuck off. It has happened to me before, and no woman feels \u201cspecial\u201d when something scary happens to them. The amount of cynicism in this thread just disgusts me and makes me wonder how many of you just hate women. \n\nIt was almost midnight, I was literally falling asleep, and I heard this ungodly sound right outside my window, jolting me awake. I\u2019m guessing some of you would be uncomfortable too. \n\nAgain, I appreciate all of you giving advice and checking in on me. It definitely helped me feel better. If weird shit keeps happening I\u2019d be happy to post again, since it seems a lot of you are interested. For now though, I\u2019m just hoping it was some cats having sweet, sweet sex. Have a good day everyone \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit 4: For some reason this post is still getting a lot of responses, and it seems like a lot of you have poor reading comprehension. \n\nWhen I called my local police department, I didn\u2019t ask them to send someone out. Multiple people, including my roommate, told me to call. I don\u2019t think I hurt anyone by doing this. I let them know what I heard and asked for their advice.  They could have said \u201cOh, that\u2019s just a cat\u201d etc and I would have believed them. They immediately asked for my address and said they would send someone out. I thanked them and hung up. \n\nI looked up the baby thing shortly after, and yes, it is an urban legend. However, at that point I had already talked to the police. I never directly assumed what was going on or made my own conclusions. That\u2019s why I was asking for advice here. Many people said they had similar experiences. \n\nI\u2019m not buying a gun, though many people have encouraged me to. \n\nWhen I originally posted this there was no body text, just the question. It got popular and I added updates to answer the hundreds of comments I was getting, rather than responding to each one. \n\nI agree with the vast majority that it was an animal. At no point did I fear for my life. I felt confused and uncomfortable, and I was looking for answers. Hence, this post. Some of you are acting like I kicked down my front door and fired 20 rounds into the bushes. \n\nMy roommate heard the same sound, so I don\u2019t think I have schizophrenia. I don\u2019t do drugs and I am not a paranoid person. Maybe it was a mistake to mention being stalked, but it has happened to me before, and was just supposed to give an example of why I may be more cautious about my safety than some of you are about yours. \n\nFor those of you saying I am mentally ill and pathetic: I still think you guys are great and deserving of love. I am a bit upset that people were rude to me when I was feeling uncomfortable, but I guess that\u2019s the internet for you.

I hope everyone has a good day today, and that we can all have more empathy for each other.","If I feel depressed after a bad day I\u2019ll try to fall asleep super early just so I get a break from dealing with and thinking about what\u2019s bothering me.

If they are trying to change genders because of the social norms around that gender, and they don\u2019t feel as if they can be the feminine male or a masculine female, aren\u2019t they just enforcing those stereotypes that men\/women are a certain way?

Regardless of your stance on pronouns and all that, it seems like gender dysphoria is a pathology that a healthy person is not supposed to have. They have a much higher rate of suicide, even after transitioning, so it clearly seems like a bad thing for the trans person to experience. When a small group of people has a psychological outlook that harms them and brings them to suicide, it should be considered a mental illness right? \n\nThis is totally different than say homosexuality where a substantial amount of people have a psychological outlook that isn\u2019t harmful and they thrive in societies that accept them. Gender dysphoria seems more like anorexia or schizophrenia where their outlook doesn\u2019t line up with reality (being a male that thinks they\u2019re a female) and they suffer immensely from it. Also, isn\u2019t it true that transgender people often suffer from other mental illnesses? Do trans people normally get therapy from psychologists? \n\n\nEdit: Best comment\n\n>Transgenderism isn't a mental illness, it's a cure to a mental illness called gender dysphoria. Myself and many other trangenders believe it's caused by a male brain developing first and then a female body developing later or vice versa. Most attribute it to severe hormone production changes while the child is in the womb. Of course, this is all speculation and we don't know what exactly causes gender dysphoria, all we know is that it's a mental illness and that transgenderism is the only cure. Of course gender dysphoria can never be fully terminated in a trans person, only brought down to the point where it doesn't cause much of a threat for possible depression or anxiety, which may lead to suicide. This is where transitioning comes in. Of course there will always be people who don't want to admit there's anything \"wrong\" with trans people, but the fact still stands that gender dysphoria is a mental illness. For most people, they have to go to a gender therapist to get prescribed hormones or any sort of medical transition methods but because people don't like admitting there's something wrong with transgenders, some areas don't even require that legally.\n\n\nComment with video of the science of transgenderism:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/MitqjSYtwrQ","I'm not talking crushes, but rather that feeling that at some time in the past you could have been really compatible.

I faked being sick and lied to my parents about reasons to stay home. Still finished high school and university though, it was a real struggle. \n\nI made a \"deal\" with my kids when they started school years ago. I let them skip one day of school a month and write it off as a sick leave etc. in exhange for them not faking being sick and lying to me.\n\nI think this was a brilliant solution. They don't use their get out of jai.. school-card every month and they haven't lied to me once (not that I've caught them atleast). The eldest is going to graduate from high school next year so it's an old system.\n\nAs I shared my groundbreaking technique with fellow dads I got destroyed. I'm apparently teaching them to be lousy and irresponsible and all that.","I do this all the time and really hope I\u2019m not the only one.","I recently got into a heated argument with a friend. I watched this documentary on how the pyramids of Giza were potential power plants and thought that this theory was very interesting. My friend effectively told me I was crazy and that I needed to stop believing in fake news and crazy conspiracy theories. However he\u2019s the first to call anyone out if they disrespect a religion or criticize someone\u2019s beliefs. So why is believing in one more acceptable than the other? Knowing that often conspiracy theories often have more evidence  to support their claim than religion?","Now this is a double standard I truly don't understand. Like most others I can see some logic behind them, or at least the viewpoint of others who enforce it. Not saying I agree with them, but I understand why.\n\nThis one though, I truly do not understand. There have been countless studies showing no real correlation between gender and body image as a teenager. Even things like steroid use and eating disorders are as common in young boys as young girls. We all know teenage boys get bullied for how they look, not being tall enough, not being buff enough, being ugly, etc. . It's not something uncommon and probably something we've seen in real like a lot.\n\nAnd yet, I never see anyone really discussing helping teenage boys with self esteem. It's even shown that most schools don't even know how to deal with their problems, only being taught about the issues girls face. I even remember being a teen, I was always taught to boost women's self esteem, but I was never taught to do the same for guys. In fact, there are many who are shocked at how insecure boys can be, and it baffles me why.\n\nSo, why do we not try and boost self esteem for boys like we do for girls?\n\nPS: this isn't some MRA or MGTOW stuff coming out of my mouth. Please don't discredit the question because you think it is.\n\nEdit: I didn't think it would blow up to this level but I want to make one thing clear, I do not want this to become an MRA vs Feminazi debate. I don't want any people saying things like \"they want men to bow down to women\" or \"well men rape women so it's to prevent that\" kind of stuff. Try and keep the political discourse civil. It is not an us vs them, its an all of us vs the problem.\n\nEdit 2: I can not take \"toxic masculinity\" posts serious because of what I heard at a seminar discussing it. I was told confidence in men is a bad thing and that they should not be confident because confidence leads to rape. So those saying toxic masculinity is the issue, my experience has said that they just want to make it worse","Don't get me wrong, this isn't like going unconscious or anything.

The answer was because Santa Clause doesn\u2019t exist, much like the Invisible Man but I truly and honestly thought (before hearing the correct answer) that it was because Santa Clause is a gift giver and the Invisible Man thought that he was doing her a favor. And suddenly, the teacher gasped and exclaimed my name, the whole class went quiet and everyone looked at me like I was some kind of rapist. I still cringe every time to this day.\n\nDoes ANYONE still get fixated on dozens of moments like this from years ago?\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for their comments. I obviously know that everyone has \u201ccringey\u201d moments but I was not sure as to how often people recall them and have a hard time getting over little things that perhaps no one else remembers.

Yes I masturbated at that age but I had my own room and I didn\u2019t do it if there was someone in the room with me.

Some background, I am a 16 m in high school and I share a gym class with this girl who is friends with my second cousin who has Down syndrome, they are both part of a special education program that my school provides. I can definitely tell she is special needs and english is not her first language as she doesn\u2019t understand some of the things I say when I speak and her accent is very thick. But she laughs at everything I say and keeps playfully touching and\/or pushing me, even though I have told her twice before to stop touching me and I don\u2019t want her to touch me.

I had never been in any non hetrosexual relationships and never thought of any men as sexually appealing.  In recent weeks I started spending more and more time with a friend who I had previously considered as not a very close one, we really erased the distance between us and are very  close as of now. Recently I started noticing that each time that I'm with him I get nervous, just as one would when falling in love... I also caught myself fantasizing about him and I having a sexual encounter... I also can't say that I don't find him pretty attractive.. Again, It does not happen to me when I'm around other men, he is pretty much the only guy who I find as cute and attractive; this leaves just one question - am I gay?","I came home from work today and went on an hour long walk with my dog, vacuumed my house, did my laundry, and cooked myself a healthy meal.

I do not have any gay family members but have gay friends, but on top of that I have regularly attended gay pride over here in the UK and love the freedom that these people who were once oppressed now have. I am not gay myself but I want equality for all sexualities and am happy to be an ally. \n\nWhat I don't really understand is why some of these events are so sexualised. I recently saw some posts on FB from a gay friend of mine and he was literally lying on the floor with his whole ass exposed in one picture. I've been to pride where men and women have been dressed up in BDSM gear, some dressed as puppies and stuff. Why does this stuff have to be associated so heavily with gay pride? I'm straight and I guess I don't need to celebrate that fact, but I wouldn't expect other people to want to see me and my partner engaging in sex acts in public, or even see me with my ass or penis out in public. In the bedroom I believe we should have the freedom to do whatever is consensual, also in modern society there are literally clubs devoted to these kinds of sex parties and stuff for consenting adults and thats awesome. \n\nBut why do we have to see that kind of stuff at gay pride events? Especially when there are kids around and stuff?\n\nEdit: A lot of people are commenting some pretty rude and hurtful stuff. No, homosexual people aren't all deviants, it doesn't make sense to tar a whole sexuality with one brush simply because some of them do stuff you don't like and to say so is very ignorant and immature. Also I've tried to be as honest as possible with my question and I did not intend to spread any bigotry or hatred towards people in the LGBTQ+ community.

This wouldn't surprise me if a vast amount of the community weren't so clued up on science, and also if they didn't care about the environment. However, Reddit usually proves they do care, so why is there such an aversion to vegetarianism, or even cutting down on *some* meat (i.e meat free Mondays, reduction of meat consumption)\n\nEdit: My replies aren't a challenge or trying to flame people, I'm interested in everyone's thoughts and want to know more.

I'm also not vegan, and didn't mean to sound \"holier than thou\" in this post - I have no pre-judgement on this subject.","In Portugal the Socialists just won the election again.

I'm not a native English speaker, but I have been living in English speaking countries for many years, so I think my level of English probably isn't the issue. Plus, it's not that I don't \"understanding\" the words, it's more like I can't \"hear\" them. I'm just trying to figure out if this is normal, or should I look into it further.","I was listening\/watching a Reddit video which was about men no longer doing innocent things as they could be accused of wrong doing  (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3BJn0BZgMuU) and it made me feel upset.\n\nA father was doing his wife's volunteer role in a church, after 15 mins of being there he was told that having a male there made others feel uncomfortable, there were 5 children there, 3 of them were his.\n\nAn uncle doesn't take his niece or nephew out to the park alone anymore as he was given \"evil eyes\" by some of the women there and was told he was \"acting\" suspiciously\" even though he was just watching the children in his care. The police even told him not to come back as he made others feel uncomfortable.\n\nIf it was a woman doing these things would people think the same?\n\n\nI don't understand that, aren't paedophiles rare in society?\n\nI know that society regards women as much nurturing but that doesn't mean women can't be creepy\/predatory too.\n\nI know that rapists and serial killers exist but I don't go outside thinking everyone out in public might be one, if I did I wouldn't go outside.\n\nI think it's sad that people jump to the worst possible think, is it illogical\/irrational?\n\nIs this a form of sexism?\n\nIs this because of society's views on men?","I'm asking this in the most non-weirdest way possible. \n\nI've noticed in some of my classes there are always a few people who have a lovely, strong smelling perfume on. Either when they're walking by or sitting near me, it's very easy to smell and it's like a breath of fresh air.\n\nWhenever I wear perfume, it lasts maybe an hour. I sometimes check and it's like it's already worn off. Sometimes I wonder if I just can't tell and others might, but I just don't get it! \n\nI think about asking what kind of perfume they use, or possibly a hair product, but I don't want to pry. Either way it makes me jealous because I can never get to that level of having my body leave a \"scent\"! I always thought you only need one or two sprits on your wrist\/neck or clothing because the amount of alcohol in perfume would ruin the point if you overdo it.\n\nEdit: This got much more attention than I was expecting!

I always wake up to my alarm feeling groggy, like garbage and wanting to go right back to sleep. \n\nI've heard of people waking up feeling rested and ready for the day. Is this true?

Please don't read this in a condescending tone. \n\nI understand if you are trans, you typically feel like the other gender. How is that?\n\nAre you basing that feeling off of gender stereotypes?

Or you don't like your boobs and hips, you wish your body was shaped differently?\n\nIs it both?\n\nThis is a legit question, please explain how you knew you felt like another gender. \n\nEdit: I thought this went without saying, but I would like to hear from people who are..

It seems like a lot of you seem to think servers make just $2 an hour and that's it. Their tips balance that out and they, more often than not, make a considerable amount over the state\/federal minimum wage so...STOP BRINGING IT UP...literally 90% of the comments are about this.\n\nEdit 2: If you're going to accuse me of not tipping and being a cheapskate or whatever spare me. No where have I said this nor do I believe it so stop with the personal attacks for simply asking a question. It's seemingly bringing out more guilt and rage then constructive conversation.\n\n----------------\n\n\nThat server is going to, by law, be paid *AT LEAST* minimum wage at the end of the day, 99.9% of the time though they make a good bit more, so the whole \"in some states they only get $2 an hour\" doesn't really make sense. If not it's illegal so saying \"they don't do that where I work\" is a problem you need to deal with. This is IF you make less than minimum with combined tips. Results may vary (some states pay minimum plus tips...CA and OR pay $11+ minimum).\n\nThe cashier at Walmart is busting her ass day in day out for minimum wage and nothing else so...why don't you tip her? The person making your order at a fast food place is dealing with people all day, smile on their face, and also take your order, prepare it, make sure it's correct...why don't you tip all them?\n\nWhy do you think that it's only wait staff that are somehow more deserving of tipping and a living wage? Why aren't you tipping other people a mandatory 15-20% as well?\n\nWhat's the difference between one low paying job we add extra money on top and another low paying job that we don't?","I\u2019m currently at a brunch restaurant and the people next to us have their child watching some annoying show at full volume without headphones?

For years now, I've been having sex dreams pretty regularly. I think 90% of my dreams involve sex of some kind.\n\nThe thing that troubles me, is that in those dreams  I'm sometimes sleeping with people I definitely don't want to sleep with. Be it a girl I'm very unattracted to, a very old dude, my best friend... Sometimes I even dream about sleeping with my sister (who is five years younger than me), and a few weeks back my very gross unhygienic uncle. I've even dreamt about sleeping with my dad.\n\nObviously, I'm horrified by these dreams, and feel like I must be some creep. In real life, I'm attracted to slightly older men, but I see that as very normal. However, incest is definitely not something I aspire to.\n\nSo why does my brain keep giving me these horrible dreams? Am I the only one who has to go through this regularly? Am I crazy?","I'm 21m and obviously there are girls I don't like but I don't know, I find atractive mostly every girl I meet. \n\nWith this I don't mean I try to sleep with every girl I meet, just I wouldn't mind.","\nI don't have a lot of friends. I guess that's why I turn to the internet lol. I'm asking not only about Reddit, but with any social media. However, I guess Reddit is the main platform I'm talking about. \n\nOkay, yeah. I post memes and pictures without much thought, but when it comes to an update in my life or a question I want answered, I always second guess myself. More times than not, I don't post it due to feeling like I'm about to open up a can of worms that is full of sarcastic jeers.\n\nI'm afraid that no one will really care about that small achievement I made or a question that has been bothering me. \n\nI guess that's just life, though.  You gotta throw your hat in whether it goes well for you or not.\n\nHeck, no one may even care about this post lmao. And yes, I do actually feel that small bit of anxiety right now.","Like when people usually say if a girl\/boy replies very quickly to your messages they like you, when I text the girl I like it takes me like 5 minutes for each message, I need to rethink what to say, think what to say in order not to drive the conversation to a dead-end and so on? Am I the only one?","Do you ever just stop what your doing and think how weird it is that your a human just like every other person you've interacted with?

My sisters loved it when they first saw her do it to a slug because they also hate bugs. Is it morally wrong, maybe. But I wouldn\u2019t go as far to call my mom deranged or any of the heaps of insults you guys have said.","I understand the difference between sexuality and  biological gender. I also understand the concept that they can both be on a spectrum.\n\nI guess where I get confused is that some people don't really feel like a gender and don't want to have one assigned to them. They often will feel that the idea that something is a 'girl' thing or 'boy thing' is something put in place by social conditioning and indoctrination.\n\nHowever a lot of transgender people feel more comfortable and authentic when displaying 'stereotypical' traits. Yes, they clearly identify as one end of the spectrum, and could explain why they gravitate towards those expressions... They feel that is not a social construct, that they were born with the wrong body and they like things more commonly associated with one gender or the other.\n\nSo how do those two viewpoints meet in the middle? How do transgender people and agender\/ adrogynous people feel towards each other in regards to how they approach gender and gender roles?\n\nEdit: Wow! Woke up to a ton of responses. Most of them are very well thought out and articulated and for the MOST part it's refreshing to see civil discussion.

I have gone to two different psychologists and neither told me that I need medication so I don't know what to do because their way of dealing with things is kind of slow and I feel like I can jump in front of a car someday (I already tried to kill myself once when I was younger but my friend found me) . So that leaves me thinking, I'm just not into being alive, why is it so wrong to want to die? Why are we always trying to \"save\" people that just want to die, I didn't ask to be born, shouldn't I be allowed to choose to die? I wish I could stop feeling everything, I don't wanna have to make myself happy to be alive.... I'm sorry for the messy text, I'm just thinking about maybe killing myself\n\nedit: just wanted to add a few things about myself for all of you lovely people sending me messages: \nI'm 20, a woman and I'm not really an extrovert, I spend most of my time inside my house because I don't have any friends in the city that I'm living but I actually like going out and stuff\n\nedit 2: after reading more things that you guys have told me I decided to go to psychiatrist, I only went to psychologists and therapists... Maybe a psychiatrist will give me some meds and\/or meaning to keep going \n\nalso, thanks everybody for saying a lot of things, I really didn't expected that this post was going to be something so big... I'm sorry that I can't reply to everyone but seeing your response really made my day better even though it was a bad one.","I was scrolling through reddit and came across a petition to have \u201cSweet Victory\u201d played on the Jumbotron after the half-time show to commemorate the passing of one of the most influential American cartoon artists of all time, Stephen Hillenburg.

I told my sister every thing Ron did and she said he has been creeping her out for YEARS. Two years ago, Ron was tutoring my sister and her friend in math. I remember my sister saying how Ron was \u2018getting too close\u2019 and he only wanted to tutor my sister, not her friend (even though he was being paid for both). \n\nMy sister came with me to my mother, and I told her everything in detail and that I plan on going to the police station whether she likes it or not. She was completely devastated and horrified that someone we trust would try this. I also showed her the thread and she says she\u2019s very grateful that all of you care. \n\nMy mother supports me and believes me. Turns out, Ron was supposed to be at work when he picked me up. We did file a police report at our local station. She said she was a bit wary of Ron at first, but because he helped us out so much, she thought she was being ungrateful. \n\nMy mother doesn\u2019t want me to give out too much information about this whole ordeal, but I can say that I\u2019m definitely *not* the first person he\u2019s tried assaulting, but hopefully will be the last. \n\nLooking back, I can see him trying to get close to me. Always offering me private help with homework, if my mom needed someone to pick my siblings and I up from school, he would drop all of his plans to just help out. I know I shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but I feel so ashamed, embarrassed, disgusted. I told my mother I don\u2019t even want to think about him.\n\n**TLDR- update. Ron is cut off from our lives. My mother believes me and we went down to the police station to file a report.**\n\nedit: I live in Florida"," Ok I'm 26 and have been robbed 5 times in my life, all 5 times was from a black male. In higschool it happened twice, I got beat up and had my phone, and cash stolen. Second time walking home from school was attacked again a few years later in my sr yr of HS and robbed of cash. I was stabbed in university by a black guy after he apporached me and grabbed me and I fought back, I had my laptop stolen. And another time in university I had my chain snatched by a black guy and he ran. The latest one was last week, I was walking back to my condo in the middle of the afternoon and I was approached by 2 black guys a bit younger than me. Told me to run my pockets and they grabbed me, I just started yelling and screaming and a parking police ran over and helped me and the guys ran off. After today I told one of my friends about this and the other times and I said this is why I avoid ghetto black guys, and she said I was racist and a huge asshole (she's white, but I'm a POC) and said we can't be friends anymore.

I know it can take time to see the \"big picture\" and that no one is perfect... But do you ever worry that you are the toxic person for other people?

Like their heads literally turn 180 degrees just to keep staring at you with wide eyes. I am ethnically Chinese as well, but born and raised in the US. We are taught that staring is extremely rude. I don\u2019t understand why it is normal there. I hate it. It makes me feel violated and like I\u2019m in a zoo. Especially when I see it happen to my family members. It makes me feel like I have to shield them or something. I also notice that men also openly stare at my chest or at other women\u2019s chests and at foreigners who aren\u2019t Asian for an extended period of time. Like until you\u2019re out of their sight. They sometimes even try and take photos. It really bothers me and I cannot comprehend how the majority of the culture just doesn\u2019t see this as scary, rude or even think about the person on the receiving end feels. It soured my trips there and I just can\u2019t get over it. Please help me understand.\n\nEdit: Hello everyone, thank you for your replies and explanations. Many have stated that it is just a cultural difference, and they weren\u2019t taught to see staring as rude or out of line, & most of the time they just do it out of curiosity and have no bad intentions behind it. (Other than the staring\/ photos of my chest type of stuff, then they\u2019re just creepy.) I would like to add that I have been to other Asian countries and experienced the same thing, as well as hearing similar stories from my friends when they visit their native countries as well.(Korea\/Vietnam\/Japan etc.) and that\u2019s why I said \u201cAsian countries\u201d in the title. Though I am aware that it occurs more often in China than the other ones, and I talked about China the most because I spent the most time there. I am sorry if this came off as a stating that everyone in Asia does this. I really did not have that intention. Aaalllsssoooo, additional explanation for why I wanted to know why it was the norm to stare: Whether I\u2019m alone or in the middle of a huge crowd, if someone is staring at me I can feel it. Even if I can\u2019t see them. Like horror movie type of stuff, you know? It makes my hair stand up and immediately puts me on edge. I always thought this feeling was natural\/ primal, like it was an evolutionary trait to help alert us of something is hunting us. People where I live ended up utilizing this feeling, and stare to intimidate, threaten, and make you feel like you gotta watch your back. Many people referred to it as \u201cMad-Dogging\u201d \ud83d\udc36 So because of this, I assumed it was just a universal human response to it. So when I encountered a bunch of people staring at me with no shame on several different occasions it was a really big, confusing shock.","I am one of those people who scrolls through Reddit and upvotes a lot of stuff.

Then once we start talking they are surprised that I'm not an over aggressive, hyper toxic masculine person and hit me with the classic \"You're nothing like I thought you'd be\" This didn't bother me until I started thinking about how many missed opportunities for friendships I may have missed because the person was scared of how I looked.\nSo I'm really seeing if anyone else feels like their outward appearance doesn't match their personality and that I'm not alone in feeling like this. ","I'm 20 and I grew up putting together sets of legos like a lot of kids and although I eventually grew out of it, but I remember trying to put stuff together with another person and it almost kinda seems like a good bonding activity? Like you get to see how well you and the other person work together to solve a problem that could come up. Dates are all about testing the chemistry between two people so why not work together on a single task and see how well you two fit? Above all that though it's just fun, and doing something fun with another person is one of the easiest ways to build a relationship. Would that be a weird date for two adults or does it sound too much like a team building exercise between coworkers?","(In this case heterosexual relationships) Like whenever I meet someone I always have this idea in mind that they can be a potential partner. This impression will go away as I get to know them.\n\nIs this normal?\n\nEdit: from the comments, I feel that it's important to point out that I am a FEMALE.\n\nEdit 2: didn't know this would get so much attention on my newly made account to ask weird questions, but thank you haha.\n\nAlso, I want to clarify that I think of other people as potential partners in a sense \"I can fall in love with them, they can fall in love with me and we can live happily ever after\" kind of thing. This doesn't mean I get attracted to everyone I meet but I always think that \"there is a potential for something to happen between us\". \n\nI hate this because it makes it difficult for me to make friends with males.","She doesn't bathe herself properly, she gets scared of the dumbest shit, hardly purrs, but will lick you for 20 minutes if you let her. She drinks water by dipping her paw in it and then licking her paw. Also, she peed in my shoe this morning. I don't know how, but there was a big puddle of pee in my shoe. She is about 12 years old.","My first language is not English. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.\n\nI'm not hating on them, they can do whatever they want. But I feel like it hating labels and then having multiple sexualities and genders contradict each other.","I don't know if I'm crazy or not, but I feel way more romantically\/emotionally interested in men and more sexually attracted to women. It seems like I fall in love with men but prefer to sleep with women...\n\n*I'm a woman. Can we stop assuming everyone who posts is male?\n\n**You all are wonderful. Thanks for sharing your own feelings and experiences!! It's been so affirming to hear from you, I feel like I'm getting a giant hug from the internet today. ","Like I just love putting my hand down on my crotch for a while and then sniffing my hand. Is there some sort of pheromone or is it just by association?","So my friend is about 5 months pregnant. When we were at my friends house (along with a few other people) she asked for a half glass of wine. \u201cCould you bring me half a glass of wine? I didn\u2019t have any today anyways\u201d. One of the girls looked at her and I guess this made her feel like she needs to explain so she said, \u201coh I could have a little bit. It doesn\u2019t hurt\u201d. \n\nMy friend brought her the wine (which she later told me was watered down) and soon, she asked for another glass. So she had about 1-2 glasses that night. \n\nMy question is, what the hell do I do when she comes over to my house and asks for alcohol? I definitely don\u2019t feel comfortable serving it to her. Even if she doesn\u2019t drink a ton of alcohol during this pregnancy, it\u2019s just playing with fire. And if you\u2019re getting NOTHING out of drinking the wine (being tipsy\/drunk) besides the taste, why drink it at all?? And she said TODAY. I didn\u2019t have any TODAY. What? So you\u2019re okay with drinking once a day during your pregnancy? \n\nI feel like it\u2019s not my place at all to tell her she shouldn\u2019t drink or refuse to serve her alcohol. If anything, it\u2019s her husbands place to tell her to stop. And he was there! He was there when she had the wine and he didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it. \n\nAnd even if she doesn\u2019t come over and ask for wine, would it be out of line to tell her maybe she shouldn\u2019t have alcohol at all during her pregnancy? I just know that if anything (God forbid) happened with the baby she would never forgive herself. What should I do? \n\nEdit: she\u2019s never had a problem with alcohol or anything. She just likes to have the occasional drink. \n\nEdit: Yes, I do understand that people drink alcohol for the taste. What I meant to say is that a pregnant woman should be able to give it up during her pregnancy if she drinks occasionally just for the taste. How many other delicious foods and drinks are there that DONT carry the risk of harming your baby? Have that instead. Just in case. \n\nI\u2019ve decided I won\u2019t tell her to stop drinking and I won\u2019t refuse serving her alcohol if she wants it. She\u2019s an adult.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s her baby and none of my business. \n\nIf it comes up, I\u2019ll ask her how much she believes is okay to drink and where she got that information. Besides, she\u2019s the one pregnant with her second child who\u2019s been reading books and research articles. So she probably knows more than me. \n\nThank you to the few of you who encouraged me to just do the damn research myself before jumping on reddit and asking strangers for their opinions. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. ","It probably wont ","I was planning to give him a bag with a bunch of snacks in it as a thank you for saving the poster I really wanted that was up around the store.

I wanted to at least say thank you. \n\n\nEDIT: \nLiterally the moment I came in he was like \u201cI saved you some other posters to see if you were interested.\u201d I was super thankful, I gave him the snacks and thanked him and he said it made his day.

This is fine.\n\nHowever, John also likes to wear a full face of makeup, dresses, skirts, lipstick, tights, etc. He is also pre-surgery and does not wear a binder. When we go out to eat\/otherwise in public, strangers unintentionally misgender him, and he gets absolutely furious. Am I in the wrong for thinking that he's out of line? I realize that gender\/clothing \"genders\" are a social construct, but I feel like he should realize that dressing in feminine clothes may make him seem to be a female.\n\nI don't know if mentioning this will be seen as offensive or not, but his outbursts are starting to put a strain on our friendship.

I would really like to get to know him better and maybe ask if he wanted to go steady. \n\nThe only thing is, I don't know if he can have sex and I have no idea how to ask. He told me I was his first kiss (despite being a really lovely guy he said most girls weren't interested in dating someone in a wheelchair), so I'm not even sure if he knows. \n\nI don't know how he came to be in a wheelchair and I haven't asked for fear of upsetting him.\n\nEDIT:\nHey, thanks for all the advice everyone, I really appreciate it. <3\nI've decided that I should wait for a good moment and ask if he wants to talk about why he uses a wheelchair. I won't ask about intimacy or anything like that because we haven't been going out long, but if things get serious I guess we'll have to have that conversation. I'm more asking because I want to understand his condition better I guess, and see if there's anything I can do to make things easier for him.\nThanks again! <3\n\nEDIT 2:\nJust to add some additional context, I wouldn't say we're boyfriend and girlfriend yet. We went on our first date on Thursday and he asked if I wanted to go on some more dates and \"see where things go\" and I said that would be lovely.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThis morning I asked him if he always used a wheelchair and he chuckled and said \"I've been waiting for this conversation\". He explained that he has cerebral palsy and has always used a wheelchair. He has full sensation in all his body (he volunteered this info, I didn't ask) but can't walk. I admitted I had been worried about asking him this and he said \"I know, I was starting to think I'd have to start that conversation\". We had a good laugh about it. :)\n\nThanks again to everyone who's given advice, shared their stories, and sent their well wishes (I was particularly tickled by people pointing out I might be the only person under 60 to use the phrase 'going steady'). <3 I'm sorry I can't reply to everyone but I'm trying my best to read them all. <3","Why is that so?

To those who have suggested complicated grief, I\u2019ve had a look at it, my grief doesn\u2019t affect my everyday life, but rather these moments in time where it feels fresh again.

Her words, \"This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me, thank you so much!\" We are still on for dinner this weekend. Thank you everyone who reassured me that I was doing the gentlemanly and reasonable thing. The best part of it all, is that while I type this, I get the distinct pleasure of listening to her sleep soundly, next to me on my couch.","I have these dreams every now and then. Where I'm dating a past crush, or just some random girl. And it's really wholesome and during them I always feel so incredibly happy. Theres a lot of handholding and hugs and cuddling and \"I love yous\". But then I wake up and I remember every girl I've ever asked out said no and I'm still single as a pringle and it's so immediatly distressing I sometimes start crying and then I feel really bummed out that whole day. This has been a recurring thing for me at least once every couple months ever since I first started taking interest in dating. And I'm wondering if its somthing unique to me or somewhat common.","I mean my friends are great, they always ask follow up questions, remember what I told them, so they are listening but I always feel like they are not interested and I try to talk very little about me?","Edit for clarity: I\u2019m a 19 year old white guy who lives in Australia.

I wrote this post because I was confused and didn\u2019t know what to do.  I was supposed to die that day, so when I woke up, I just felt lost.  I didn\u2019t want to talk to my parents or anyone really about what I did, so I turned here.\n\n  I\u2019m blown away by the support everyone has given me.  I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not really used to this, but I\u2019ve read all the comments and I promise they mean so much to me.  I\u2019m doing fine now.  I woke up with a bit of a headache and some bruising around my neck, but other than that I feel ok.  I\u2019ll take some of your advice though and visit the doctors to see if anything is wrong.\n\n  Thanks again to everyone for your sincere comments and advice.  I\u2019m not going to lie, I still kind of feel like shit, but I also haven\u2019t felt this great in a long time.

Here is why (i also vent here) :\n\n**-i cant socialize:** I am socially \"retarded\" and never made friends (this is not an exaggeration). I dont know where to look at and doubt what to say in every situation, even with my family. I either say too much or not enough. I am either too quiet or too loud. Multiple people have asked me if i was high while being sober. I appear akward to people. \n\n**-i lack coordination:** I always hated sports while other kids loved it. I have always been the worse at sports class and I was not overweight. I cannot throw something properly even at a small distance and cannot catch a ball. I still dont know how to dribble even after training for a long time. In sports team, i dont know how to cooperate.\n\n**-i take a long time to understand a simple concept, compared to my peers of my age:** I often \"get\" a joke after a very long time. When I try to understand some simple thing, I make dozens of research and have to look at multiple resources before i finally understand. In class, during a practical work i dont understand what im supposed to do. I dont understand how to do what im supposed to and often fail it (link this to the lack of coordination and my social retardation which makes me tremble my hands).  I have to repeat something many times to do it well. You can't just show me a simple thing and ill be able to perform it like you, like others do. I also read slowly. \n\n**-i dont think for myself:** I dont have critical thinking skills. I dont have my own values and i dont form my own opinions. I just take it from someone who seems correct to most people. Because i am very slow, my sister tells me how to perform certain actions (yeah i didnt know how to close some door). I dont figure things by myself and i dont have the capacity to. I cannot be independent. I  even have to ask strangers on reddit this question, because I cant think of a solution for myself. I often dont think first of the \"bad\" things, why people would do such things. I dont think of the malicious motive the could have first. This makes me naive and paranoid. \n\n**-i am very emotional:** my emotions control me. Im like a child. I dont handle frustration well and i am impulsive. I can cry for almost no reason, for exemple being hungry. When in a stressful situation, i will be even less logical than i am at peace. I will only think of what i should have done after, becausd i think slowly. For exemple once i was under pressure to find a special sock for my mother (very important for her theater piece) and i just looked for it in a brutal way, mixing every other sock in the drawer in my way, looking at some socks multiple times. I know any other person would have just done something like putting every sock on the other end of the drawer and then inspecting each sock one by one, and find it quickly because you only look at a sock once.\n\n**-in my family some people are very unlogical**: for exemple my mother doesnt understand fractions, no matter what way try to explain it. She is very emotional and i think I inherited her intelligence (iq is moslty genetic) and learned from her behaviors as a young child, which modeled my brain irreversibly. My father, grandfathers and sister are very intelligent and very logical. I always turned to them for my problems. But i guess i have some of my fathers capacity, because i understand math way better than my mother. I lost the \"genetic lottery\" I guess. \n\n**-i am unlogical**: I dont understand logic games and puzzles. I cant think of simple combinations with a rubiks cube without having a method. I find it difficult to wrap my head around abstract concepts. I cannot count to large numbers and confuse them often (like 5000000) I am very bad at visualizing and turning an image in my head. I overcompliate stuff, just like this post. I cant just simplify things. \n\n**-when i was a child i was very intelligent, compared to others:** I had excellent grades and almost skipped two classes. I enjoyed reading and writing and had a broad vocabulary in my native language. I enjoyed studying. I am a failure now and get bad grades. I think my brain did not evolve (of course, I learned new things but its just knowledge, not other ways of thinking). I think I was just fixed with a low iq and at one point it was high because the other people were still developing their brain while mine was \"set\". \n\n**-i dont express myself well:** It is hard for me to write this. I dont have the words and some sentences dont seem to have much meaning (english is not my native language but even in my native i cant). Something can be very clear in my mind but i cant express it.\n\n**-i dont know how to perform basic tasks:** i dont know how to cook. I have trouble with basic hygiene. I didnt even know how to close a door, or how to use a card reader. I dont understand how locks work. I dont know what is the proper way to walk. I dont understand how to act in emergency situations. I dont know how to do basic handy work, it is even hard to drive a screw. I dont know how to properly navigate. I always lose track of which way is north. I find it hard to take a route i havent before, even with a map and when i know the disposition of the streets.\n\nI have considered suicide but life can be worth it. I dont know if suffering is better than nothingness. I am constantly dreaming of being intelligent and successful. I know i cant be what i dream but i dont want to be miserable. People here wont tell me to kill myself because its against the rules. I dont know if i just give up on life. There are no miracles but maybe you guys can tell me what i should do, since i cant figure it out be myself?","Do you ever feel like you're bottling up so much but can't really share with anyone, that sometimes you wish something really bad would happen to you or someone you know, just so you would be able to express your pain without judgement from others.

I\u2019m from the states but have been living abroad for almost a year now, and it seems that for the Americans it\u2019s a much bigger deal to them that they\u2019ve been to Paris compared to my European peers, so maybe the opportunity to remind everyone that they\u2019ve traveled is irresistible.

Wake up and open my eyes everything is just...off. LIke the tint is wrong. I could almost describe it as like an overcast hovering above me. Everything is shit. Literally nothing is as good as remembered. Fun online game? Its shitty why am I even playing. Make some food I like? Bland... Look at my hands typing and they seem further away than normal. Im not insane I know they are my hands and all that but at the same time it just doesn't look quite right. Its similar in some ways as being really stoned for a prolonged period of time, very autopilotish.\n\nThis happens to me sometimes. Might just be for less than a day....longest was a week or so. It has happened high, sober, rested, tired, pretty much randomly. It scares me because sometimes it really feels like don't know myself and I find smells and lighting triggering. Very strong de-ja-vu feeling.\n\nI'm struggling with this right now. Earlier today the lighting was constantly reminding me of the lighting in the abusive home I grew up in. Both inside and sunlight. I know the lighting is not similar, because I would not live like that. I know from experience that when I \"snap out of it\" the lighting wont be triggering me anymore. But earlier I was getting a flood of bad memories as if I had literally woke up in my childhood home. So logically I know my brain must be making shit up.\n\nWhat really bothered me today though, was I looked in the mirror. I didn't feel a deep dread or see a demon behind me...im not crazy. But my face looked.... different. Wider. More focused\/intense eyes and other minor differences. But for some reason, I just couldn't bring myself to make actual eye contact and have avoided the bathroom mirror all day.\n\nIf this goes normally, in a few days I will just be me again so to speak.

With the exception of a half sleeve that turned out to be a total mess (thanks to the \u201cartist\u201d) but it\u2019s being removed and will be gone soon. \n\nI got all my tattoos between the ages of 16-28. The goal was to be completely covered, and it was cool when I was younger. I\u2019m now 32, married to an amazing, blank canvas man, and pregnant with our first child. Now, when I look at my tattoos I wish they weren\u2019t there. I wish I had never gotten them in the first place and hate that I was so impulsive in my youth. \n\nI should also note that while I have a lot, they can all be concealed under professional clothing and they have never prevented me from obtaining a high-level, professional job. I just don\u2019t want them anymore.\n\nEdit: a lot of commenters are assuming I regret my tattoos. Not once did I mention regret, in fact I started my post off by saying I like my tattoos. I don\u2019t regret them as at one time I was elated to have them. But years have gone by and the luster has worn off. They were awesome when I was a kid, but now, when I say I wish they weren\u2019t there, I don\u2019t mean I regret them, I just wish I had blank skin again, as if that were even possible. \n\nSome others are assuming my tattoos are shitty or meaningless, again not so. I heavily researched my tattoos and artists and have full, custom pieces, designed by me, and they\u2019re pretty badass (with the exception of one, that\u2019s being removed). \n\nThis post wasn\u2019t about being ashamed\/embarrassed of bad art or regretting my youth. More it was just about growth and change and realizing that I have become someone that I had not anticipated being when I was younger. Society tells us 18 = adulthood, but I\u2019ve come to realize this is not the case. Kind of like a \u201cI wish I would have known then what I know now\u201d type thing. \n\nFurthermore, some of you guys are real a-holes about tattoos in general.

It is kind of a long ride, and so I typically leave earlier than I need to in case something happens with my bike. Because of this, I usually arrive at school 20-30 minutes before the bell rings. The teacher of my first class locks the door to the classroom until the bell rings, so I normally stand outside waiting. I don't do anything to pass the time, I just stare at the wall and think about random things. Recently, teachers and students have been lightly joking about me doing that. \n\nAdditionally, I do the same thing whenever I have nothing to do in class, like when I finish a test with lots of time left in the class. I just stare at my desk and think. All my other friends always ask me if I'm okay when I do that, and one friend in particular never seems to believe me when I say there's nothing wrong.\n\nI asked one friend I have about it, and she said that it's incredibly odd to just do nothing, and that normal people would at least look at their phones or listen to music. I do have a phone, but I don't like to use it very much because I wasted a lot of time doing nothing but looking at reddit over the summer.\n\nSo, reddit, is it weird or abnormal to pass the time by just standing and thinking?","I'd say I'm pretty socially deprived as someone who has always been really quiet and shy at school, and although I'm an introvert I often find part of myself wanting to be around people all the time and just live life. It's like I'm an extrovert in an Introvert's skin and it sucks. I do this thing as a coping mechanism where I'll usually act out scenarios where I'm at a party or hanging out with a bunch of people and making them laugh in my head. Sometimes it gets to the point where I actually laugh out loud or sometimes even talk out loud and its embarassing. I only ever do this alone obviously, but it kinda saddens me that I've reached the rockbottom of loneliness and pretending I'm popular in a different reality is starting to depress me even more.\n\n Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else does this or if it's just me being a total weirdo.","I don't like to be sad, no one does, but I feel like I'm constantly pulled towards it and find myself sometimes relishing the situation, which makes me feel like a POS and makes me feel more sad, it just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy at a point.","I'd say that a good 40% of the opinions expressed there aren't all that unpopular at all.

Not only was I a terribly unhappy person, but I wanted to be \"cool\" and thought that ditching my friends would make me liked by people that were cool and popular. \n\nI was really mean to this one girl. I would say mean things about her and her parents, prank call her house, and once got into a heated argument with her (we played a sport on the same team). I was in the sixth grade. We ignored each other after that and we both ended up transferring to different schools and I have not seen her since. \n\nAfter all these years, I still feel incredibly guilty about how I treated her. She was my friend once and I turned my back on her and caused her anger, pain and probably feelings of worthlessness. I am a sensitive person and insults from others have greatly affected my self esteem; I am disappointed that I so carelessly insulted others knowing how much words can hurt. After my experiences in middle school, I made a commitment to treat people with the compassion, respect and kindness that they deserve, and to not take other's kindness for granted.\n\nAnyways, I found out that this person has a social media account and was wondering if it would be weird to message them an apology? It has been about 15 years since I last saw her. One of the people who bullied me a lot when I was younger apologized to me when we were in high school, and it is something that I deeply appreciated and will never forget. Would it be weird to send the girl an apology or has too much time simply past?\n\nEdit: after reading comments, both those supportive and unsupportive of the letter, and considering my own intentions, I carefully wrote a letter of apology. I made sure to write sincerely and not focus on myself, and made no excuses for my behavior. I sent the letter via Facebook messenger, but she never responded to it, which is perfectly fine. I had no expectations, and feel as if a weight has been lifted off my chest. I will still strive to be a kind, empathic person to all people that I meet, and put my bad behavior in the past.\n\nEdit 2: if anybody is still keeping up on this, the girl responded. She apologized for taking awhile to respond, as since we are not Facebook friends, my message went to a different inbox. But she said that the apology meant a lot to her. She said that it does not matter anymore, and that she understands that it was a time when a lot of people did mean things. There were no hard feelings or anger and we wished each other well. I am glad that she finally got closure however, and do not regret sending the message at all.","Edit: Thank you for all of your responses!

But I can't stop thinking that transgenderism is a mental illness akin to other forms of body dysmorphia. Maybe not as physically dangerous as anorexia, but it seems like there is a strong connection to poor mental health and transgenderism. When I hear someone say that they felt like the opposite sex since they were 7 years old, I have doubts. Why can't a person just enjoy activities that would normally be associated with the opposite gender without claiming they are trans?

If your friend annoyed you...\"Dude, stop being gay.\" If you wanted to insult someone it would be \"Fuck you faggot!\" Now all of this wasn't said with repercussions or fear...I mean it was fully acceptable lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n People would laugh, or simply understand that whoever was called gay or a faggot was just told off harshly. It was so common I remember every time we got homework or a test was coming up I would say \"Fuck...another test...this is so gay...\" Now...when in high school there was a club for gay kids and it definitely settled down a bit...like saying gay was still acceptable by many but you were always thinking about who was listening or who it could bother\/hurt....who would tell on you etc. so it was said in a sort of person to person voice tone, whereas in middle school you could yell it as loud as you wanted and no one gave a fuck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you remember that time?

Communicating with people and discussing things is great. But asking what your BMI is is not really a debatable topic. Asking something like 'how do you feel about BMI' or 'how has your BMI affected your life\/ how well does it correlate with your actual health and how do you deal' would be something 'acceptable' to post. Or asking for recommendations on stuff, or asking for clarification on a topic or concept that you have spent more than 3 seconds googling.

My friend is also leaving for the national guard in January, so it\u2019s extra frustrating because I have limited time left with her. She and I have been inseparable and always did things together. We were the two friends that everyone knew were best friends. Now I feel like I barely know her. She\u2019s grown so distant with me and it sucks. It sucks a lot. It\u2019s been a rough few months for myself, but I did wanna address that I do have a lot of other friends that I have been hanging out with.

I\u2019ll give some back story that might explain my attachment. \n\nWhen I was about 4 I saw a stuffed cat at a Toys R Us and begged my grandma to buy it for me. I begged insistently through the whole store because this cat just felt different than any of the other toys I had. Eventually she agreed, and I named it the dumbest thing, Tail-Black-Nose. I had him for a very long time, I took him between my home and my grandparents home across the country, he was with me the first time I flew on a plane alone, he was there to comfort me after I was molested, he was with me when my city lost power for two weeks during winter, he was always there for me.\n\nThen he was just gone. I\u2019m not sure which state I lost him in, if it was a house or an airport, if my mom had just taken him, or what happened but one day I realized he was just gone. Even through that was probably a decade ago, I still cry like a bitch thinking about how I abandoned him, even if it was accidental. And within the past couple months I\u2019ve started having almost daily nightmares about him getting torn apart by someone or something that doesn\u2019t know his value while this stuffed cat screams. When I told my therapist about this reaction that I have to a fucking stuffed toy, she said that the best way to help would be to either find him or get a replica.\n\nThe problem with that is that Toys R Us sign around, and even if they were they wouldn\u2019t still carry the same toys and brands from the early 2000s, late 90s. I have combed the Internet. I have been able to find cats that are similar, but they aren\u2019t him. I can still draw TBN, so I suppose it would be possible to give a drawing to someone who sews, but I worry that they wouldn\u2019t get it right, especially since I only remember what the material felt like, I don\u2019t remember what it was.\n\nDoes anyone know anything that could help me get him recreated? If you want me to draw him and post it I could, but idk how that would help.\n\nEDIT: some people have asked for description, so I drew from memory, and gave as detailed of a description as possible.

His eyes are hard and I think black or brown (not connected on the inside like some toys), his nose is hard and pink. He was small, just barely able to stand on one of my hands. He had enough stuffing to stand, but his paws\/arms leaned forward a little as drawn. Not sure if this is because over time I ended up bending them like that, but I don\u2019t think so.

How the hell do I get out of conversations from old people without being rude and just like, shutting the door on them mid sentence or whatever?\n\nI have a family friend who's in her 90s and she recently had a knee replacement so I've been walking her dog two or three times a day for a couple weeks, and probably will be doing it for still at least a couple more. And every time I go over she ends up talking to me for about 20min before I can even get out the door with the dog, and then another 20-40 minutes when I get back before I can actually leave. And I didn't mind it at first but I'm already spending 2-3 hours of my day doing this with just the walks and the commute, and I just don't have the time to listen to her tell me the same stories over and over and over for an hour twice a day too. \n\nI will say before everyone tells me I'm heartless or whatever she she's not alone; her son and his wife and kids visit her every single day and she has multiple friends that come over most days as well, she still goes out to community events and stuff, and that's just while she's recovering. When she's not she's got a job she loves and a bunch of other community involvement and she's constantly interacting with people. She's not some poor elderly recluse, she's just really chatty.\n\nAnd I have this as a bigger issue just generally. Old people at the grocery store, old people at church, old people at restaurants, old people at bus stops, always so so so chatty.\n\nI don't mind listening to them and sometimes really enjoy it; my problem is that they do not seem to read any of the social cues I put out that are meant to signal \"okay I need to leave now.\" If I'm visiting someone who's not old and I say \"alright well I'll see you in the morning\" and then head for the door, they will let me leave. But if I do that with old people they will just keep talking to me and I will just be standing there, hand on the doorknob listening, and then I might catch a pause and I'll open the door and they they'll start talking again, and I just standing in the open door listening, and I'll catch a pause and say \"it's been nice to catch up, I'll see you in the morning\" and take one step out the door and they'll just start talking again and I'll catch a pause and say \"I've really got to head out now\" and step all the way outside but then before I can shut the door they'll just start talking again  and I'm just standing outside the open door listening because like, I'm not just gonna walk out and shut the door on someone who's trying to talk to me. I've missed buses because the old person at the bus stop would not stop talking to me long enough for me to slip away onto the bus even though I kept trying to leave and telling them I needed to. I've been trapped *on* the bus by old people doing the same thing. \n\nSorry this turned into more of a rant than I intended. But old people do not seem to respond to any of the social cues I know to use that mean \"I need to leave please let me go.\" How the hell do I get away from old people talking to me without being rude?","This went on for a few months then stopped happening.

However, I can see that she was just expressing her feelings of anxiousness and simply phrased it strongly\n\nGirl 2: 'the previous night, I was busy relaxing. As a result of that, today I have anxiety bc I didnt do my hw. This girl also has a strong history of attention seeking, and is more of an issue than G1. This brings up another point I didnt mention in orginal post that you guys brought up, which is other mental issues, like OCD, depression, PTSD, among others. W G2, I personally take offense to her stance on PTSD, which I feel from the direction of this post, I can safely add on. I told G2 my personal experience w abuse and trauma (I have by now been diagnosed with CPTSD, this is prior) and she said that it doesnt matter, as other people have depression, and that I shouldn't mention it again. A year later, she told me that she had been a victim of a violent attack, and that she had extreme PTSD and anxiety. She then proceeded to act out and yell out these things about blood and gore on her, but only when at parties, and that the only thing that would help is of a male friend held her. Now, I understand this is possible and understandable under the circumstances, however, there were none. After another year, I called her out on it by inconsistencies (said shot and stabbed and killed a man, but with 0 injuries and etc), and after addressing every issue with it, she finally admitted that it didnt happen, and she was tired and imagined it (so dreaming). During this time, I gave her support for her unlikely but valid trauma at the time while she continued to tell me to live with mine, and resulting in more severe and worse trauma (I got abused more while she screwed around).

Clearly, you\u2019re weary of everything you read, and don\u2019t understand the purpose of the sub; it\u2019s for people who can\u2019t ask questions of any brevity, severity and weight to the people they know personally. I couldn\u2019t ask this question to anyone I know, and Reddit has proven to be extremely helpful to people like me. I used the term \u201cemotional abuse\u201d because that\u2019s what my therapist used a couple years ago. Report this if you think I\u2019m lying. Don\u2019t accuse people without taking action if you truly believe they\u2019re lying.\n\nThank you to the people who showed some level of support, gave a shred of advice, and\/or told me about their experiences. You know who you are, and I\u2019m grateful you took time to speak to me.

I just don\u2019t understand why binge watching TV is okay but playing something isn\u2019t.","I'm a 22 year old black male from London. I regularly read so many posts on Twitter by black people poking fun at \"white people things\", which would definitely be considered racist if the roles were reversed. I don't agree with it, but why is this considered an ok thing to do? ","I have a babysitter who looks after my kid for me from time to time. She's a really sweet kid who's very responsible and my daughter loves her. My wife and I invited her and some of her friends to come over and go swimming at our apartment pool yesterday. Her mom drops her off and she's with three friends and they are all really excited to swim and lay out. \n\nI have a neighbor. We all call him \"bandaid\" because the joke is that talking to him is like ripping off a bandaid. It sucks but ya gotta do it. \nBandaid is a 40 something year old man who gets extremely drunk and vulgar. My first experience with him was him saying \"hey bro, is that your wife? She's very pretty. I swear, I'll get your permission before I fuck her.\" He tried to play it off as a joke when I got upset and when I told him if he ever spoke about my wife that way again he was going to have a problem he then decided to let his white trash flag fly and start screaming about fistfighting me and blah blah while being drunk. \n\n\nAnyways, long story short my babysitter comes up to me after they've been swimming for a bit and asks me if I knew bandaid. I told her yes and asked if he was bothering her. She said he swam up to their floats and said \"damn, you girls look delicious. \" She said she told him that she was 13 and her friends were 13 and 14 and he said \"if you're 13 then I'm 13 too.\" and swam off. \n\nI went over and told him to leave the girls alone. I told some of my neighbor friends who were out there too. \n\nAbout an hour later my babysitter comes up to me and asks to call her mom because she wants to leave. She's about to cry and she told me that she was swimming and splashing with some other kids her age who live her and bandaid swam up behind her and went to throw her in the air into the pool but that his whole left hand went up the bottom of her swimsuit and he bare hand grabbed her ass. \n\nI was livid. I told bandaid to leave the pool or I was going to beat the shit out of him. All my neighbors turned on him once I told them what happened. Bandaid said \"I was just playing its a accident quit being such a pussy.\" \n\nHe got out and left. I'm not a tough guy or a bad ass but I really wanted to hurt him. How should I handle this? Had that been my daughter I would have drowned him. \n\nI told my babysitters mom what happened over the phone and she came and got her daughter and brought her husband. Badaid was gone but her daddy was extremely angry. I feel bad because I should have been watching her and keeping her safe. Her parents said that they didn't blame me but I blame me. I should have stomped bandaid out and if I see him today it may be a problem. \n\nEdit: I need to add in that her parents did call the police about this and I haven't gotten an update yet. Also, management at my apartment complex was made aware. \n\nUpdate: A police report was filed by her parents. Talked to her dad a few minutes ago. He said \"The guy had a warrant in Georgia so the police picked him up. We are pressing charges. \"","Am I the only person that has conversations with real people in my head while I'm alone (mainly in the shower)?

Do people not use MMS (mult-media messaging services aka picture\/video messaging) anymore? Why is Snapchat so popular? Why do people care so much about their streaks?","Want to thank everyone for their responses! This really got me thinking a lot more about things I could be doing now, and gave me some great perspective.

I appreciate every one of you\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nNot sure if this is the right place to post this, and probably should have used a throwaway. First let me make it clear: I love my family\/kids and I absolutely would never trade them for the world.\n\nYet I can\u2019t help but feel regularly that this just wasn\u2019t at all where my life was supposed to go. I feel tied down a lot. I feel like I am a free spirit trapped in someone else\u2019s body. I feel like my kids deserve a better mom for even feeling this way. \n\nReally having a hard time even putting this into words. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just going through the motions.

I don\u2019t give a shit about money, or things. I don\u2019t give a shit how nice my car is, or my house. I just don\u2019t care about this shit. I\u2019d rather have nothing and be able to see everything.\n\nOne day you\u2019ll leave this world behind, so live a life you will remember...","Basically during my teenaged years, I was part of the alt right. Basically I thought black people had genes that have them low IQs and made them more aggressive which made them commit crime more. I believed this stuff because it was presented as scientific and no one ever explained how it was wrong to me. People usually got pissed off if i came out to them about those ideas. But later on I realized the guys i talked to were a really bad crowd so i just left. \n\nBut nowadays I catch myself thinking really racist things. Like a black person will do something I hate, and I\u2019ll think like \u201cstupid fucking n******!\u201d Usually it\u2019s like a black person saying using the word \u201cwoke\u201d is racist for white people or something like that. Or I once heard a black person equate using the N word to committing murder or being a pedophile. It\u2019s normally stuff like that. But, the evidence shows whatever differences exist are because of environment, so there\u2019s really no difference between a black person and a white person in terms of intelligence or morals or whatever. I feel like it\u2019s bad to think in a racist way because there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about being black or about black people, so I agree it\u2019s wrong to think like that.\n\nHow do I stop being racist in this way? How do I be more colorblind? \n\nAlso is it bad to share my bad past with someone? I seem to get treated badly whenever I admit it, even when I say I got out of it. \n","Has anyone been through this and what happened when you told the person\/were told by the person?\n\nEDIT2: thanks for all the advice and PMs but I am not actually in this situation myself. Hopefully the insightful answers here can help people who are actually pondering this question IRL","I'm not sure how to explain this well. For one thing, I am mainly an introvert and I LOVE living alone. I get to come home from work, strip down to my underwear, play guitar wherever I want in the apartment, say stupid shit to myself, etc. On the other hand, I sometimes start getting lonely and sort of wish I had more friends and a more active social life. It's almost like I want good friends and a girlfriend that ONLY want to hang out on the weekends, but also are very good friends to me. Is anyone like this? And if so, how have you managed to balance this?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for responding. I can't get around to responding to everyone, but I would like to let you all know that I very much appreciate you guys sharing your personal thoughts on the matter, as it makes me feel that I am not alone on this issue. \n\nI would like to add another detail about my situation. There's also the fact that I have severe insomnia and I toss and turn in my sleep constantly, which makes it near impossible to be able to actually sleep in a bed with another person. I felt insanely uncomfortable with my last girlfriend for this very reason. Normally, I would toss and turn a bunch and if I couldn't sleep I would sometimes just get out of bed at like 4 or 5 a.m and start pacing around, play guitar, or just watch TV. I find that this would be nearly impossible if there was someone else here with me.","Sometimes I'll be lost in thought and then my age will come up, and I have to take a second to remember what age I am???

But what I can't understand is why someone would go out of their way to cause damage when they don't stand to gain anything from it.

It's VERY deliberate and time consuming and if there's any emotional connection at all, intimate. When you tell me \"it was an accident\" or \"I was drunk\" or anything along the lines, all I hear is \"Asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission\" because there's no way you didn't know exactly what you were doing and the implications the act carried with it.","I\u2019m at a small, private university in the Midwest with a fairly large amount of Asian transfers, mostly Chinese.

Is there a majority of people who really don't?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for my first silver ~ and also to clarify, I'm not meaning to imply that I'm always talking to myself rather than just thinking silently. Tis just an occasional thing, I spend plenty of time silently thinking, and writing.

I\u2019m not saying we should shame obese or overweight people, but we also shouldn\u2019t act like being obese and overweight is an okay thing. No one should make fun of anybody\u2019s weight and we should be accepting of different kinds of people, but obesity is one of the leading causes of death and disease in the United States. I\u2019ve got a little extra weight on me, but I don\u2019t want people telling me that it\u2019s okay. I want to actively lose weight and improve my diet.

I am not saying to go up to fat people and tell them to lose weight. That\u2019s wrong and disrespectful. I\u2019m also not saying that we need to ostracize fat people for being fat. I\u2019m saying that the fat acceptance movement, where they believe that fat is the best and healthiest option and tell skinny people to gain weight, is not okay. We as a society should want to live our healthiest lives. Of course, it\u2019s okay to be fat and body positivity is a great thing, but living healthy is what we should aim for. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m aware that this is a touchy subject, and that it might offend people unintentionally, but if you would like to debate this point, please don\u2019t be a jerk.

I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve seen and read this a lot of times already when it comes to American meals and daily routine. What is this about? In my country (Germany) literally no one takes vitamin pills\/gummies daily. Nowhere is it recommended or advertised. I also read it can be pretty easy to overdose on vitamins and this is in a lot of instances not healthy, so how come America has even vitamin supplements for children and encourages them to take them? I mean, couldn\u2019t you just eat fruit and vegetables? What kind of diet makes it necessary to take additional vitamins daily? Is this a cultural thing and if so, are Americans educated on the dangers of doing so?

Sometimes when somebody posts about being suicidal, someone will respond with a very heartfelt response about their own personal experience with depression, how the OP isn't alone, and how they can always reach out and PM them if they need someone to talk to. I truly admire and respect those kind of people - this post isn't about them.\n\nI'm talking about the people who barely acknowledge any of OP's concerns, and will simply reply with some impersonal bullshit like\n\n> Suicide prevention hotline: 1-800-273-8255\n\nOr something similar. Do these people actually think they're helping? If I posted about having suicidal thoughts and someone just copy and pasted a fucking phone number without actually acknowledging anything I said, it would just reenforce the idea in my head that nobody actually cares about me.\n\nEvery time a celebrity commits suicide (rest in peace Anthony Bourdain), these posts start popping up everywhere and a lot of them just come across as super insensitive karma grabs. I've been severely depressed before but never suicidal, so maybe I just don't understand what's actually effective in these kind of situations. \n\nEdit - This post picked up more traction than I was expecting, so I figured I should respond to one of the more common points people have made. As many people have said, some of you have been in a dark place and found that the hotline helped pull them out. And that's great! This post was in no way intended to bash the suicide prevention hotline, or discourage anyone from trying it. But this post has also shown that there are a lot of people out there who tried the suicide hotline and ultimately felt let down by the outcome. And if you're one of those people, that's totally okay too. I was in a very dark place in my life for many years and I know a hotline would not have helped me, which is in part what compelled me to write this post. But even if the hotline isn't for you, there are still so many more resources out there. Reach out to people in your life who you can talk to, I know it can sometimes feel like there's no one but I promise you there are people who care about you. And if you truly don't feel like you can talk to anyone in your life, find a support group and become friends with people going through similar situations. You don't have to go through this alone. There's so much more out there to try, and I promise you if you give yourself a chance that one day you will get through this.","I am in my mid-20s and I feel like I have very few complete memories of the things I did when I was younger.

But I also don't struggle with remembering things I have to do at work and stuff in my daily life, or general knowledge issues. Does anyone else feel that way? Is that just the nature of memory?

YouTube account:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCltV_UztTTq6F2cYm4X_gZg (This isn't shameless promotion I don't do that stuff) \n\nEDIT 2: WE MADE IT HOME SAFELY!!!","Today at lunch I sat with a few of my co-workers and some of them were talking about past after office dance clubs they went to. At one point one of them told the others \"you guys should come next time... Except you, you would hate it\". She said this referring to the fact that there's loud music and people go there to dance. \nWhile it is true that I don't like those types of environments and I would definitely not want to go, I found that comment really unnecessary and a bit hurtful. This is not the first time that this has happened to me before, especially in the workplace.\nHow do you deal with being excluded for being introverted and not wanting to partake in the more common activities that people your age like to do like parties and dance clubs?","So many companies push the NonGMO idea even though GMO foods are probably our races best chance for ending hunger and making food cheaper an more efficient.","I was raised in the south of the US, and because of that, I was brought up with some racist tendencies. Thinking all black people would grow up to be criminals and other awful things of that nature. I moved up to Michigan around 3 years ago, into the town where my mother grew up. I'm white, as is most of the population here. The racist beliefs here are much more extreme and openly expressed, even more so than where I grew up. I feel that, during my time here, other people's toxic beliefs seeped into me without me realizing. \n\nI'm ashamed to admit that whenever I see a black person in my school, my mind immediately goes to \"criminal.\" The moment I realize, I mentally slap myself and think \"No, not all black people are criminals.\" I heard somewhere that your first thought defines what you were raised to believe, and your second defines who you truly are. I believe that, but I'm not sure about me in this situation. Does still instinctively thinking of other races as bad people make me racist, even though I don't truly believe it?\n\nI try not to treat my colored friends any differently from my white ones, but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them. I'm terrified that I'll say something offensive to them and show this nasty side of me that I don't want to have. I fear that rumors could start that I'm a racist, when I'm not (I don't think). I don't believe that racism is a good thing or an okay thing, and I don't want to be who I was raised to be.\n\nIf you have any advice to give, I will gladly take it. If I am racist, without my intention, please tell me. I want to get rid of this toxic, evil part of me. Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit: Some people are commenting on the fact that not all people in the South are racist, and that is very true. I didn't mean for it to sound that way at all, and I wholly agree. What I meant was that the community I was raised in, and the people around me, were very racist. Apologies, and thank you all for the advice. As several people have suggested, I'm going to talk to a close friend of mine about this, and get her opinion on it. Thank you all.","By far potentially the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me. Nothing sexual was going on in my mind. I was really hungry, hadn't eaten anything over the course of the day, and had a grilled hamburger with air-fried fries inside, including jalapenos, a fancy type of cheese (not sure), a fuck ton of amazing seasoning (not sure either), and your basic vegetables. It tasted so good, but I felt the pleasure meant for my tastebuds, on my dick; suffice to say, I'm pretty fucking confused right now.  \nThis is not sarcasm or troll, the burger was so good I genuinely got an erection. Like I wasn't horny by any means, but I had a great feeling there as if I were orgasming or something, and from then a boner was then quickly born. No other cause, no half-naked girl walking by. Maybe some mental mis-association between pleasure from food and sex or something like that. Thoughts?  \nEDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger.

Apparantly sleeping issues\/lack of sleep can be a reason for bad memory. Mental health problems and\/or medication treating those might also have a role in bad memory. Also taking pictures as memory triggers or writing down stuff might be a good trick to remember more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: Thanks guys, I didn't think this would get so much attention, but am happy that I'm not alone with this.

It is not. 4\/5 times that someone is using their phone on speaker, in the bus, on the street, in a restaurant, they are black. I've noticed this up and down the west coast as well.

We've both been the others' first serious relationship are are currently living together. We met early on in University and because of this she never really established any other friendships instead spending all her time with me. I've let all but a few of my own friendships slide in recent years as we've pretty much become each other's entire social circle. \n\nI've been encouraging her for awhile to try and socialize with others because that's obviously just healthy. A few months back she confided in me that she had a crush on a co-worker but of course she'd never act on that. At the time it was like: \"Cool, isn't this great that we trust each other enough to say things like that?\"\n\nSince then her co-worker has gotten fired so they've begun hanging out socially. Sometimes with others, sometimes on their own. She knows my discomfort with this but assures me she wouldn't do anything that would jeopardize our relationship. Here's the thing though, she's already told me she likes the guy. How am I supposed to stand by and watch this happen. Like it almost doesn't matter if nothing ever \"happens.\" The fact is she's going out to get drinks with the guy she likes. And she's texting the guy she likes. And she's inviting me to hang out with her and the guy she likes. \n\nThis is the first socializing she's really done since we started dating and under normal circumstances I shoukd be and want to be totally supportive of this. So it would feel pretty dysfunctional and possessive of me to ask her to stop. And even if I ask her to set boundaries with the guy (hanging out in a group instead of 1 on 1) isn't the implication there that I can't trust her and she can't trust herself to be left alone? That feels shitty too.\n\nWhat do you all think of this? I'd love some advice on how to go forward because right now my reasoning is all gunked up with jealousy and I mostly just want to kick, scream loud, and break stuff. \n\nTL;DR. My girlfriend has been hanging out with a guy she has admitted to having some more than lukewarm feelings for. She swears nothing will \"happen\" but I already feel betrayed. How do I proceed?\n\nUpdate: We talked. I told her I'm not going to control her actions but what she is doing is painful for me and if she continues hanging out with this guy it's eventually going to end our relationship.\n\nShe was guilty and aware of what she was doing was wrong once it was brought out in the open. Still, it was hard for her to accept that I was essentially giving her an ultimatum.\n\nAs people have  pointed out, the fact that choosing me over him isn't an easy answer is a bad sign for the relationship. I can accept that. What I'm not going to do though is forbid her from doing what she wants and either a) we stay together and she resents me for controlling her or b) she goes behind my back and has a relationship with the guy anyway. \n\nI'd rather let her realize this is a passing crush and not throw our relationship away for it or give her the freedom to start a new relationship honestly. Both these sound better than cheating on and controlling one another. \n\n Thanks for reaching out y'all. Seeing everyone's take on this really helped me get outside my own head and approach this with a bit more conviction in what I was feeling.

Child hasn\u2019t invested anything in its life. \n* There are also more people who have be saddened if mother dies. \n* You can have another child. You can\u2019t have another mother. \n* If you save the child it\u2019ll probably grow up without a mother. And the father may\/will probably grow old without a wife.\n\nI can\u2019t think of *many* reasons to choose a child other than it\u2019s a child and not an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s an aweful situation to be in but the option is obvious, imo. \n\n----------\n\n::: By the way I\u2019m using \u201cit\u201d for the child because I can\u2019t be  bothered to type they or he\/she every time. Deal with it. \n\n::: Okay so this got way more attention then I thought it would. People are pointing out I'm too logical. I guess so because I sure am not feeling the emotions right now. I was just thinking about the situation and the decision makes sense right now, might not then. \n\nStill I think it's better that I've given it some thought now. I sure hope no-one here has to make this decision. \n\n::: I want to mention some of the recurring answers here so you can think about them too!\n\n1 I get mother will\/might feel guilty for choosing herself over the child if she makes the decision.\n\n- What about the child blaming itself for killing its mother?\n- If father is forced to making the same decision due to mother's request, he could blame himself\/child for the death of the mother?\n- Do you feel guilty every time you put your needs over others close to you?\n\n2 Why is the mother more valuable than the child, or vice versa?\n\n- They're not. I just think mother should be saved because of the points above. Mostly because I see life  as \"work\" (not a job). I believe after having \"worked\" for many years so I can enjoy my fulfilling life, and then dying is more of a disappointment. Not just for me, but for others as well, they too worked on building a relationship with me. This to me is more tragic than never having \"worked\" and dying without knowing anything. Can you tell me that you enjoyed every second of you life and never felt anything like work?\n- Also keep in mind child has never felt emotions\/thought\/understood\/regretted\/wished, pretty much everything you do. He is a bundle of reflexes.\n\n3 It's an emotional decision, I'm thinking too logically...\n\n- Maybe. I think emotions should be taken in account, but not entirely biased on it? I thought part of being adult was try to separate those two and do what's reasonable and best for everyone in the long run, like eating broccoli, yuck. \n- Are you considering other's current\/future emotions or just yours in that moment? \n\n------\n\n###Conclusion: It is a difficult decision because everyone perceives the world differently.","I\u2019ve looked and this seems the best place I could find to ask this question.

This restaurant is really popular, but is also really expensive, and somewhat difficult to get in. \n\nI have been to this place once before, when a different company paid my bill (because apparently a one person meal here can easily go into triple digits, and I don't have that kind of money to throw away). Their appetizers and desserts were phenomenal, and the service was great, but the main course of prime rib (what they're most known and praised for) had no seasonings. None whatsoever. It was like they just threw it in an oven on a low temperature for a few hours, and didn't do anything else. When I asked for steak sauce to try to give it some flavor, they informed me that they didn't have any. I still ate it, but I can honestly make steaks that taste better than that for about a tenth of the price. The person I was with had chicken, and had the same issue. \n\nI got a look at the menu for the upcoming christmas party, and the prime rib and chicken are the two non vegetarian options, and the vegetarian option is some sort of a tofu\/mushroom steak, which I can imagine will have the same issue. \n\nSo, my question is: would it be rude for me to sneak in a small bottle of steak sauce?

Short version of this in tldr:\n\n\nAs soon as I started getting responses and PMs from people about how toxic\/sexually abusive Mike and Lucy were being is when I decided to tell my mother, father and aunt. I showed them this post. They\u2019ve read *all* the comments. They didn\u2019t know that Lucy was sneaking Mike in. It was very scary to tell them and I broke down crying to them because this has been happening for awhile. They hugged me and comforted me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen them so angry in their life. My mom had to literally convince my dad not to beat up Mike. \n\nAlso, my aunt said that Lucy has bipolar disorder (which she\u2019s never told us) and that she is probably not taking her medicine. I did some research and apparently hyper-sexuality is something that can happen during a manic episode. \n\nObviously, my conversation with them was short since since I told them right after my post and they had made it clear that they wanted to catch Lucy that day rather than confront her and have her lie and make up a story. \n\nI went up to my room with Lucy with a glass of water. I did my homework and I told her again about how awkward her having sex with Mike is, and she *offered to pay me* $70 to keep it a secret. I took the money and then Mike snuck through my open window a couple minutes later. Lucy told him about the cash she offered and how I accepted it, he said \u201cOh so finally you\u2019re not such a prude anymore.\u201d and he said it with the creepiest smile ever (I was terrified). I told them I was going to sleep, and they immediately started to have sex. \n\nRight after, I texted my mother, father and aunt. They barged in my room with laundry and pretended like they had something to tell us. The weirdest thing happened... Lucy & Mike looked at them for a couple of seconds... and literally continued having sex. It was disgusting. It made me question their sanity. Everyone was shouting at them, they slowed down but didn\u2019t come to a full stop until I threw my glass of cold water on them. Mike shouted \u201cWTF IS WRONG WITH YOU??\u201d to me. \n\nThe whole thing was scary. My mom held my dad back and they told me to leave the room. All I know is now, Lucy is living with her mother (my aunt) and Mike is at his apartment, banned from coming to my house. We know their information (address, full names, etc.). My parents recorded them catching Lucy and Mike (only audio) and we\u2019re going to the police station tomorrow to make a report. My aunt hopes that Lucy getting arrested will convince her to take her meds. \n\n My parents will be putting me in therapy because they think it\u2019s too much for me to handle (I agree). Anyways thanks to everyone who commented, I\u2019ve read every single comment. If anyone has any further advice I\u2019d really appreciate it. I hope this ordeal is over soon, because if Lucy and mike get charged (which I\u2019m hoping) I\u2019ll have to go to court.\n\n**TL;DR- I told my parents and aunt about the whole Lucy\/Mike sex in my room situation. They were extremely upset and my mom had to convince my dad not to beat up Mike. Lucy has bipolar disorder, which only my aunt knew and is probably going through a manic episode and not taking her meds (a symptom is hyper sexuality). Lucy paid me $70 to keep quiet about her having sex. Lucy and Mike were caught in the act by my parents and aunt. My parents recorded them catching Lucy and mike. We\u2019re going to the police station to file a report tomorrow.**","I know this is a hot issue and I am genuinely asking in good faith, not to start an argument or stir the pot.  \nI see it happening more lately: Dr Who is now played by a woman.

As long as it's consensual, you do you. But I'll admit that I do get turned off when someone I'm interested in has a bit of a past, especially with casual hookups. I'm not the type that's interested in that at all (again, you do you nothing wrong with that) and I'm very much the relationship type. Personally, I'd only have sex with someone if I'm in a serious relationship with them. Obv a lot (most) people will have had previous partners, but it tends to bother me if those partners were just hookups\/FWBs. Exes don't bother me as much because at least it was someone they were in a relationship with.

My mom is threatening to tell the police to drop charges (which is unlikely to happen), but I\u2019m still scared. Any advice?**","I'm a Christian conservative white male teenager. Sometimes it feels like saying those words immediately means several things:\n\n1. Christian means I'm an idiot, because I believe in a God. It also means I'm hateful toward minorities or those with varying sexual orientations, because hating and disagreeing\/disapproving are apparently the same thing. It means that the very word 'science' must make me melt like the witch in the Wizard of Oz, because there's no way religion and modern science could coexist in any fashion. And it certainly means that the 'Christians' you see on TV that picket soldier's funerals or the ones that deny entrance into their church for shelter during\/after a hurricane, I agree with everything they're saying\/doing.\n\n2. Conservative means I love Trump as a person, because ofc, why wouldn't I love such a conceited sicko? Agreeing with *some* of his policies must mean I'm a homophobic boy's club supporter who wants to take away the rights of gays and deport everyone. It means that I'm stubborn and love my guns, and want all forests cut down so we can frack everywhere.\n\n3. White male has come to mean that I'm completely and totally unable to understand what others go through if they are not white and\/or male. I could be racist, I could be sexist, and it could mean I'm not interested in diversity at all. But I certainly can't be spoken to about what happens to you if you're different, because \"I wouldn't get it\", and if I try to debate such issues, I'm not allowed. After all, I simply can't comprehend it. What point is there in trying to educate those who don't understand the struggles you face?\n\nI always hear about how we're evolving as a society and becoming more \"diverse.\" But occasionally, to me it doesn't feel like we're becoming any more loving or accepting, it feels like our biases are simply shifting. Does that mean we aren't becoming more diverse? No, not at all. We've come a long way. But the fact that me simply asking this question makes me nervous I'll get told I have \"white privilege\" and I'll be labelled as ignorant (which has happened before, thus the reason I'm on r\/TooAfraidToAsk) just tells me that I have every right to ask how others feel about the \"diversity\" working forward *and* backwards?\n\nAnd just so I'm clear, this is *absolutely* a question I want to see answers for, as well as personal stories, thoughts, and whatever else this question brings to your mind. **Just avoid the nitpicking**, I don't need comments like \"God and science can't coexist\", that isn't the point. I didn't ask so you could tell me why my beliefs and opinions are wrong, I asked so I could see how others feel on the frequency of putting people in boxes.\n\nEdit: This question hasn't been up for very long, and I've already gotten lots of responses! I am so glad that this many of you have taken the time to explain to me how you feel about the question at hand. The majority of your answers have been focused, considerate, and well thought-out, and I thank you for that :) Please feel free to continue giving your opinions on my inquiry, I am absolutely fascinated by what I've read so far. \n\nAnd to anyone who complimented me for coming up with the question, I thank you as well. The question just sort of popped into my head, and I quickly found an outlet that turned out to be full of people willing to give intelligent and clear answers. This sub has pleasantly surprised me, and I will definitely be visiting here more often.\n\nEdit 2: I uh... went to sleep because it was like 1 AM when I wrote this. When I got back, it seems like things got a little out of hand. It's really hard to answer all these questions and respond to every point when some of them feel like they're targeting me as a person and my beliefs, which were never supposed to be part of this. It was supposed to be that you all told me how you felt about people being categorized before they were known as an individual.\n\nSome of you took it as me thinking labels are totally wrong. That wasn't it. I did not mean that labels should not exist, but that the weight that you believe they have should be reduced. They should not have nearly as much of an impact as they seem to. And I also did not mean that you can't make a quick analysis to know if someone is a threat to you in an in-the-moment decision, or if you see a \"Make America Great Again\" you can't confirm that they're *probably* avid Trump supporters. I understand that as well.\n\nSome of you took it as \"I'm a white privileged male, tell me why I deserve to be treated this way\", which wasn't the point either. This is not a victim post. I have never felt oppressed. I have also never felt like me being white and male has given me more power over others. But I'm young and naive, I'm probably wrong. I get that there are some things I won't understand because I haven't experienced enough, and that \"my race has been on top for centuries.\" But I didn't intend this to be part of the question. I was more interested in how others were boxed, not why my boxes were there.\n\nJust keep in mind that I am completely open to whatever responses you give me. I just wanted to clear up my thoughts in a more easily visible place than the comments section, so that I can respond to as many of you bringing up similar points as I could. And I appreciate the patience, I had to sleep at some point >_<","I mean wen someone I know wants to show me a video on Facebook or YouTube and you feel obligated to watch it, sometimes for several minutes  \nIt just bother me ","It can not be juice if it is yucky ","I\u2019m sorry if \u2018butt crack\u2019 is too explicit, lol.

The only other reason I can think of is because we value kissing as an emotional connection, we become happy for the fact that we get to kiss the person we like. Meaning that it only has value because we give it value and it inherently has nothing to do with lips touching but the social circumstances of what we gained. But people still like to kiss well after they've passed 1'st base. A married couple, who have been together for 15 years will still value a kiss, so that's where I'm stumped.\n\nEdit: I think I might have given off an impression that I dislike kissing, it's not that.

Should I apologise?","I think most people know the voice I\u2019m talking about, but my question is how do they get it? They aren\u2019t born with that voice so do they just embrace the stereotypical \u201cgay voice\u201d when they accept their sexuality? Also, obviously not every gay man has this voice, but a lot do. ","With things like abortion or birth control or gay rights or womens rights or anything like that, why do people even care when things like this don't affect them if they aren't gay or pregnant or something?

I just can't find my voice. Whenever this happens, I just stay quiet for the most part and don't interact. But the thing is it doesn't happen all the time.. other times, I'll get along with everyone, handle everything by myself. That just makes things super weird. I just feel so... unnatural, so fake. And uncomfortable, in my own body. Like, I'm a different person every single day. Some days I can talk and articulate my words properly. And other days, I cant. I stammer, can't get my words out the way I want to. Nobody understands what's wrong with me either. I don't think anyone ever notices this but I can feel it. It's just.. there's something, that's always holding me back. I wasn't like this all the time tho.. it might be the trauma, it might be sthng else..idk. But it bothers me so much. I feel so alone and lonely because of this. I can't open up to anyone and bottle all my feelings up. I often wonder if this happens to others as well. I just had to let it out so I made a post.

I'll usually be part of them too. They feel like dreams, but I'm awake and in control of them.

I used to make an absolute fool of myself while drunk as a teenager too and get embarrassed\/cringe about it now.\n\n Is it normal to feel embarrassed still? Or do people learn how to move on and forget about it?","As the title says - my (19F) dad has been emotionally, verbally, and psychologically controlling and abusive of my family my entire life. My mom, the breadwinner, acknowledges this and says she hates him and wants to leave him, yet refuses to stand up to him or actually leave him, and caves every time he demands ANYTHING. A few days ago, after one of his typical bouts of insulting me and telling me I'm worthless and good for nothing until I'm reduced to crying and scratching the skin off the backs of my hands and unable to say anything except \"I'm sorry\" for hours on end, I finally snapped and admitted he'd driven me to the point of being suicidal earlier that day (I have attempted suicide before, and both parents know, so it's no joke). He first smirked and said I wasn't serious, just trying to manipulate my mom (to do what? She follows his every order anyway), and later told my sister, then me directly, that it was best if I killed myself, and he hoped I did. He told my mom I was lying when I said he'd done the same to my sister a few years back, then gleefully unplugged the phone line to keep me from calling her and showing I wasn't lying (she later confirmed I was telling the truth). I ran outside with my phone so he couldn't take it from me and called her in a panic, asking what to do, knowing this kind of control is textbook abuse and scared of what he'd do next. When I went back to my house the door was locked. I spent the evening with a family friend who was kind enough to have me over while I calmed down.\n\n\nIt's been a few days and I convinced my mother he was fueling my depression, was dangerous enough that he could really push me to suicide next time he encouraged me to do it, and it would be best for me to spend the six weeks before I return to college at my aunt's house, away from him and the toxic environment. I've brought all my study materials with me to continue my summer pre-quarter prep work. Today, out of the blue, my mom texted me to tell me she would pick me up on Saturday because Dad convinced her my textbook was too hard for me to work through alone. She knows - and I know - that if I go back, he'll use the \"tutoring\" as an excuse to continue telling me I'm worthless and a failure, to tell me I should kill myself (he has explicitly said he won't stop doing this), and will punish me especially for having the gall to move out. I sent my mom several long texts explaining this, admitting I can't stop her if she wants to do this, but begging her to not send me back home with him, because I'm terrified of what will happen if I do. She replied with exactly one text: \"I'll be there at 3 pm. Love you, Mom.\"\n\n\nDumbfounded, I asked if she'd gotten any of my messages. She wrote back that she had. For the record, she and my father have called my aunt together to talk to her tonight, and have not called me at all, nor even once asked my opinion on any of this. I had no warning and was offered no chance to discuss this sudden decision. Everyone around us - including the policemen who came on Tuesday night after answering my distress call when my father, who had been threatening to call the police and lie to them that I was actively trying to commit suicide so they'd imprison me in a mental ward if I didn't come out and talk to him, started breaking the bathroom door down to get me out and corner me - has said the best thing is to give my father and I space between us, until things seem safe. Many people, including my college psych counselors, have advised me that my dad is abusive. A family friend who is a domestic abuse survivor has offered to do whatever she can, including paying for me to fly out and stay with my grandma in another state, to keep me away from my dad, and the general consensus seems to be not to go back home with him if he makes me feel this unsafe. However, if I refuse to go home my parents may refuse to pay my college tuition and board, which would make it hard to continue - despite being a state school, tuition and board are 15,000 each, and the loans I've looked up would hardly cover that. I can try to scrounge together what I can between getting a job and taking out loans with no credit to speak of, but needless to say it will be difficult. This is a top twenty nationally ranked research university I've been admitted to, and have already spent a year attending; I'd able to pursue my dream of becoming an aerospace engineer here, but not if I can't pay my costs of course. If I can't pay college and my parents refuse to, I'll survive by getting a job somewhere, but I'd be very angry at both my parents (I suppose I already am) and it would just be a mess.\n\n\nSo my question is: what do I do? I have one day, tomorrow, to decide everything. Then the next day my parents will be here. I'm wracked with grief and fury and shame and doubt and fear and I'm afraid I may not be thinking clearly about all of this. I have no money of my own and no job experience because my father forbade me to get a job as a teenager. Advice?","26M here. We've known eachother since little. Always cuddly and loving. I remembered cuddling her and watching cartoons since she was able to walk. But since I was 14 I started fantasizing about her. We started cuddling and kissing. Confessing and shit.

Which is opposite to her younger sister, who's kinda into kissing and exposing herself openly around me. The three of us hid this from their parents, and when they were around, they weren't picking it up.\n\nMy parents have been polite and courteous in talking to me about it, and I'm grateful, but I couldn't stop thinking about her still.

Not too long ago, one of my friends said that \u201c[their] life was awful and [they would rather be] hit by a bus and die than go back to school.\u201d I (seriously) told them that they meant a lot to me and that it would crush me if they killed themselves, and I got laughed at and told by multiple people at the gathering that \u201cit\u2019s just a fucking joke, calm down.\u201d It really didn\u2019t seem like a joke to me, and I got pretty embarrassed afterwards.\n\nWhy has the internet (and consequently, those who use it) become so nihilistic? I\u2019m honestly worried that some people are seriously asking for help and being taken as jokesters. How do I know who really needs someone to talk to and who is just complaining about their lives?","even though I know I haven't done anything worth laughing at I still feel this way","Why is it that such a majority of those who oppose abortion choose to use the terminology 'pro-life' to describe their stance on abortion when in every other context their position is essentially anti-life or pro-death? Not saying that all pro-lifers are they same, but for a huge majority of the most vocal opponents of abortion, they also support the death penalty, they support zero-tolerance \"tough on crime\" policies and mass incarceration which deprive individuals of their lives, they oppose universal health care, oppose protecting the environment, they support waging war on other countries, have no compassion for refugees fleeing war and famine. Why is there such a consistent overlap between these two seemingly contradictory positions? \n\nThey want to force women to carry fetuses to term, but any policy that would take care of or provide for those children once they're born is an evil socialist freebie in their eyes and therefore not acceptable. In other words, they're only 'pro' life which hasn't actually become life yet.\n\nSo why use the 'pro-life' terminology?","I just find it weird how people say, \"I love my parents!\". \"I love my dad!\".

Some yahoo who buys a handgun and throws it in his desk drawer and forgets about it, where his kid finds it and blows his face off is not in any sense a member of a well-regulated (meaning \"well trained,\" in modern parlance) militia.\n\nSo rather than trying to tiptoe around the Second Amendment when it comes to gun control in the USA, why not go all-in on Constitutional Originalism, something popular among conservatives, and insist we enforce the Second as worded literally. The founding fathers were not stupid and specifically referred to gun rights clearly and without ambiguity as existing solidly *within the context a citizen militia*. It's the wording, stupid. We must enforce the wording.\n\nWhat does that mean for those of us who want better regulation (in the modern meaning)?\n\nIt means a gun owner must prove competency, training, responsibility, and mental and social coherence. They must go to the gun range regularly and demonstrate proficiency and safe handling and safe storage. Why? To prove they are militia material. This is the specific intent of the Second Amendment, unambiguous. We must enforce this clear intent of the founders.\n\n1. A militia member needs to prove competency and train regularly or lose militia readiness and therefore legal ownership. \n\n2. A militia member needs to have their gun available and safe, getting it stolen or used without authorization points to someone unfit for militia duty and therefore legal ownership.\n\n3. A militia member who gets a new style of gun must have new training requirements: you don't buy a handgun, prove you're good with that, and then get a rifle, and assume your militia readiness, and therefore legal ownership.\n\n4. On and on, many avenues to explore here legally.\n\nIt's \"regulation\" in the meaning of training, but it also represents regulation in terms of a bottleneck that will weed out plenty of incompetent, careless, and mentally unfit people that we currently do not have a handle on in the USA, simply because they do not have the wherewithal to jump through these hoops. Hoops, by the way, that any genuinely responsible gun owner is already doing, so there is no new burden for them.\n\nGun ranges will love this, they can charge a small fee for certification and training. If you're worried about lots of militias in the modern meaning of a group of politically motivated nuts: what is proposed here is not social organization, this is merely gate keeping into the wording of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe legal status quo of gun ownership in the USA, in the last 50 years, has strayed from the true wording of the Second Amendment. We must reassert the original wording.\n\nI think this is a legal approach rich with potential, and we as a nation should explore it to cut down on the intolerable carnage.\n","It isn't.","Over the past weekend there was multiple mass, accidental, child and spouse shootings.\n\nThis is the only Sub on Reddit over seen this news reported.

I believe we should have a gun license course, test, and vetting procedure that includes a 100 hour Firearms Standards and Ethics course. \n\nThis is the only logical thing to do in a country where this regularly happens. Herd immunity does not work with fire arms, and having guns so easily accessible DIRECTLY creates gun violence. \n\nWith more stringent policies, we can effectively ensure that only competent, legal, and responsible citizens become gun owners.

As with the last few megathreads, this is not a 'live event' megathread and as such, **our rules are not relaxed.** Please keep this in mind while participating.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\n[White House letter](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2019\/10\/08\/us\/politics\/white-house-letter-impeachment.html)\n\n[New York Times](https:\/\/nyti.ms\/2APiHzr)\n\n[Fox News](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/impeachment-inquiry-white-house-not-comply-pelosi)\n\n[CNN](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/politics\/live-news\/trump-impeachment-inquiry-10-03-2019\/index.html)\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n>The White House declared war on the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, announcing that it would not cooperate with what it called an illegitimate and partisan effort \u201cto overturn the results of the 2016 election\u201d of Donald J. Trump.\n\n>In a letter to House Democratic leaders, the White House said the inquiry violated precedent and President Trump\u2019s due process rights in such an egregious way that neither he nor the executive branch would willingly provide testimony or documents, a daring move that sets the stage for a constitutional clash.\n\n---\n\nPotential discussion topics, as we're into heavy political theory territory:\n\n- Impeachment is an inherently political process; when a witness in a court case is subpoena'd for testimony, the court may order their arrest for failing to comply. With impeachment, the consequence for failing to comply with a subpoena is... potential impeachment. What risk does the President run of forcing Congress to impeach him for failing to abide by Congress' exercise of its impeachment power? \n- Does the President instead decide what the impeachment power is? \n- To what extent does political safety guarantee the holder of the executive office a position? \n- To date, no President has been removed from office by the impeachment process - having declared this process illegitimate, could the President make an argument that any resulting impeachment and conviction is illegitimate as well? What would the political ramifications be?","[Link Here](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/national-security\/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign\/2016\/12\/09\/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.67b5cd9b76b3&tid=sm_tw)\n\nBeginning:\n\n>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.\n\n>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials.

Is it instead better left to the agencies to manage the situation to avoid a perception of political bias, or is a perception of political bias immaterial\/unimportant?\n\n- The framers of the constitution were particularly concerned with the prospect of foreign interference in American politics. Should this factor into impeachment consideration and the interpretation of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' as understood at the time it was written, or is it an outdated mode of thinking that should be discarded? \n\n---\n\nAs with the last couple megathreads, this is not a 'live event' megathread and as such, **our rules are not relaxed.** Please keep this in mind while participating.","Washington Post has reported that Trump revealed code-word clearance information to the Russian foreign minster last week.

He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State\u2019s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.\n\nIt was also noted that none of this was the US's to reveal and would likely damage our relationship with the country who shared the information. \n\nFull article can be found [here](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/national-security\/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador\/2017\/05\/15\/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_trumpintel-0504pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.881380d40e46)\n\nThe question going forward is what are the ramifications from this.

He breaks it down into 5 primary problems:\n\n1. **Geographic sorting**: partly through gerrymandering but much more through our own decisions to live near people with similar political leanings as us, we have created a situation where very few Congressional seats are competitive and Presidential elections are decided by increasingly fewer voters.\n\n2. **Straight-ticket voting**: increasingly less people are voting for candidates in different parties and simply voting straight-ticket.  This makes races even less competitive and leads to most races being little more than a census of party members in an area.  \n\n3. **Primaries have become the new general elections**: because so few seats are competitive, the real races for most seats are in the primaries which have particularly low turnout dominated mostly by the most partisan voters, leading to representatives that are even more partisan.\n\n4. **Congress grinds to a halt**: because of number three, representatives are increasingly unwilling to collaborate and\/or compromise for fear of being primaried.  They feel they have to maintain ideological purity in their votes and rhetoric.  This leads to Congress having difficulty accomplishing anything.\n\n5. **Anger at politicians grows**: all of the above leads to anger and disillusionment from the electorate who grow increasingly frustrated with Washington and the political system.

This case makes it so that that is not viable to tell the FBI or judge you don't remember something critical. \n\nAnd in regards to the prison sentence, while it may not seem like a lot at first, the charge isn't for colluding with Russia, its for lying to the FBI.

The original Senate plan proposed raising it to $1,650.\n\nThey would also lower some individual tax brackets from 22.5%, 25% and 32.5%, proposed last week, to 22%, 24% and 32%, respectively.\n\nBut those changes, as well as reforms to help lower costs for so-called pass-through businesses that pay taxes through the individual code, would expire in eight years to avoid adding to the deficit.\n\nBecause the Senate is planning to use a special budget reconciliation process to pass the tax bill, the proposal must not increase the deficit after 10 years, according to an arcane Senate regulation known as the Byrd rule.\n\nThe changes to the bill mean it would add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, down from $1.5 trillion in the original bill and below the threshold needed to pass the legislation on a simple majority vote in the Senate.\n\nBut more importantly, revenues turn positive in 2027, adding $30 billion to the Treasury, according to an analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. That indicates the bill would meet the Byrd rule requirement\".\n\nWhat impact would repealing the individual mandate have on the healthcare industry?\n","Today is election day in Alabama with a high profile race between Doug Jones (D) and Roy Moore (R) for former Senator Jeff Session's seat.\n\nFinal results are expected at around 8:15 PM Eastern, according to the New York Times.\n\nCoverage of the results can be found on the [NYTimes website](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/elections\/results\/alabama-senate-special-election-roy-moore-doug-jones?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) and on [FiveThirtyEight](http:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/live-blog\/alabama-senate-election-results\/).\n\nPlease use this thread to discuss the election and its results.

All they are doing is cutting back hours so they aren't forced to cover employees' medical insurance. Typical big business: Just like Walmart: Wring your workers out for all you can get, work them JUST under the amount of hours where they would be provided some kind of health care security. Just a shitty company more than anything else but no reflection of the election at all but more of an attack on the new healthcare law.\n\n **JANCOA - 350**\n\nUtter lies. Jancoa is a janitorial outfit in Cincinnati, OH whose owner testified against the new health care law in congress. Funny that this reports she is laying off 350 workers when the owner herself REPORTS THAT THE ENTIRE COMPANY EMPLOYS 320 PEOPLE.

There is a potential risk of becoming vulnerable to not-so-benevolent or effective leaders in the future.

Republicans from McCain to Johnson to Paul criticized McConnell and Republican leadership for the secretive way the bill was put together. McConnell apparently didn't even know where all his Senators would fall up to the last minute - as seen by the fact that VP Mike Pence was flown in and stood around the senate for about an hour as it became obvious that he did not in fact have the votes. Does McConnell failure to get this passed jeopardize his leadership - and is there anyone who would have the support of Republicans to replace him as majority leader?

For a time, the change seemed to have at least some positive effect in the intended direction:  Trump began using a teleprompter more often rather than solely speaking off-the-cuff, and Trump's legendary Twitter outbursts seemed to become less frequent.  Trump's campaign staff (and children) were able to convince the nominee to go with a more \"traditional\" VP pick in Mike Pence to placate the Republican base, even though Trump reportedly was not very confident in the pick.\n\nHowever, if this report is true, it seems the Trump campaign staff may be giving up on that goal, and reverting back to Lewandowski's \"Just let Trump be Trump\" campaign strategy.\n\n------\n\nMany possible implications to discuss:  \n\n* If Manafort is no longer trying to rein Trump in, will we see even more attacks on the likes of the Khan family, as well as more attacks on purported \"allies\" like Paul Ryan and John McCain?\n\n* Does this make the prospect of Presidential debates more or less likely?  (That is, is Trump's recent skittishness on the prospect of debates coming from himself, or was it a strategy that came from his campaign advisors, which he may now abandon?)\n\n* How does this affect Trump's fundraising?  One of the earliest stories about the interaction between Manafort and Trump was that the new campaign manager had to essentially beg Trump to put in the work to raise campaign donations.  If Trump is back to calling all the shots, does he go back to his old ways, when he was only raising a few million dollars per month with next to no cash on hand?","Mattis' resignation comes a day after President Trump announced that US forces will be withdrawing from Syria.

","How good did the pundits do this year, anyways?\n\nAfter 2016, the common narrative was that the experts had missed the TrumpTrain, and there was much gnashing of teeth about how blindsided folks were. Discussion by Nate Silver and the team at fivethirtyeight.com has shown that this was mostly unnecessary, as the [results](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/the-polls-are-all-right\/) were within [one normal polling error of 2-3%](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton\/). This suggested that people misunderstood the probability of events happening (Trump winning certain states, for example) and were caught off-guard. This of course begs the question \"what about 2018?\" \n\nI've heard a few stories around Reddit of eager young liberals angry that they were blindsided again, and that the results have been a disaster, far off from expectations. I doubt that perspective very much, and set out to examine that claim. It should be noted that I'm notoriously bad at predictions, and overfit my data due to slow returns; for about two hours, I believed that the Democrats were not on track to win the election and (due to my bias) was apoplectic. If you got a text from me saying, \"God help us all,\" I apologize for having wasted your time.\n\nI have analyzed the 538 predictions and the actual results at the polls, and I present my results here. I focused on the 98 House races that 538 said had less than a 90% certainty. There were 37 Democrats predicted to be winners, and 61 Republicans. I had to manually transcribe results, so this was an attempt to limit the time I needed to copy data over. Additionally, this is the upper-limit of the 80% confidence interval (\"80%CI\" from 10% to 90%) that 538 published with their data, so it is a convenient line of demarcation. As of ~5 pm on Wednesday, GA7 and TX23 are too close to call, while OK5 went for the Democrats - these are important, because they were the only potential upsets which were so unlikely as to be excluded from this confidence interval, with predicted probabilities of 91.06%, 95.96%, and 92.38% (respectively). I additionally excluded ME-02 from \"win\/loss\" analyses, because the Single Transferable Vote system makes such a determination difficult at this time. The final votes and results may change by certification, but the vote shares are given as of 5 pm as well, from the NYTimes website. The predictions used from 538 are the \"lite\" predictions which are derived from the polls alone.\n\nThe 1-sentence summary is that the 538 predictions were very good at both qualitative predictions (who will win) and quantitative predictions (what vote percent will the favored candidate get). \n\nThe 98 races I looked at had an overall average win probability of 72.0%. The projected winner of these races won 84.5% of the time, indicating a better-than-anticipated projection capability. I binned the data into 5% boxes from 50% to 90% and determined how often the predicted winner actually won in each example. For the events with probability less than 60%, 538 was slightly less successful at prediction than their probability, but at higher probabilities, they over performed. (See the Table and Figure below.)\n\nFor the vote share, there was an average predicted 80%CI of +\/-5.2%. All but two races (WI-01 and FL-25) results were within this confidence interval, a 98% success rate. This indicates that 538 was too conservative in their 80%CI assignment. Using the Excel Solver Add-In, I optimized a function to ensure that only 80% of the results were within the new CI; the observed 80%CI is +\/-2.8%, indicating a much tighter correlation between predicted vote share and observed vote share. This also qualitatively fits with the understanding from 2016, that a normal polling error was 2-3%. This \"normal polling error\" helps explain why there were so many upsets in the <60% probability range, as the average predicted vote share for these races was 49.7%, indicating that a 2.8% voter error in the wrong direction could sink a candidate.\n\nIncumbents won 67.6% of the races they were in. Their predicted average win probability was 74.7%, indicating a slight anti-incumbency (7.1%) advantage that the polls did not capture. Democratic incumbents slightly outpaced predictions, averaging 2.5% better voter share than their predicted shares. Republican incumbents hit their voter share predictions almost perfectly, only performing 0.4% better than projected. No Democratic incumbents that were predicted to win lost, but 8 Republican incumbents who were predicted to win lost.\n\nAll-in-all, in the most competitive 98 House races, 538's \"lite\" poll prediction method was incredibly accurate. They were within their statistical limits remarkably well, and were overly conservative in their assumption of errors. Their confidence interval was nearly twice as large as the observed confidence interval in this region. There should be high confidence in their predictions using this method moving forward.\n\n\nMedian Probability | Counts | %Success | %Difference\n---|---|---|---\n52.5% | 11 | 45.5% | -7.0%\n57.5% | 13 | 53.8% | -3.7%\n62.5% | 7 | 85.7% | 23.2%\n67.5% | 9 | 88.9% | 21.4%\n72.5% | 11 | 90.9% | 18.4%\n77.5% | 14 | 92.9% | 15.4%\n82.5% | 16 | 100% | 17.5%\n87.5% | 17 | 100% | 12.5%\n\n[Figure depicting the data above, with a line illustrating perfect prediction rate](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BGAYdJF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","An announcement is expected later this week that the Justice Department under Jeff Sessions intends to undo the 2013 policy of federal intervention in state-legalized cannabis:\nhttps:\/\/apnews.com\/19f6bfec15a74733b40eaf0ff9162bfa\n\nThis comes after a number of states have legalized and regulated sale of the plant for recreational use.

For example, is the gifting of Supreme Court nominations to the president of the day a violation of the separation of powers concept, in that it would appear to give the executive a degree of direct control over the judiciary in a way which has very meaningful effects on future governments and their freedom in legislative scope? Or if you take the second example I raised, should one branch of government have the power to potentially deny another branch of government access to parts of a legal document prepared for the government as a whole - particularly when the branch of government with that power may be the branch under investigation in the aforementioned legal document?\n\nI do realise that changing the US Constitution in any way is extremely rare and a very complicated, difficult process by design. I am asking in this thread whether or not it's practical, or whether it *could* be done - I'm merely asking if, in the opinions of political commentators on this forum, changing or updating the current separation of powers is something which *should* be done.

How should they do it?","I've been trying to figure this one out lately. I subscribe to a weather blog by a meteorologist called Jeff Masters, who primarily talks about tropical cyclones and seasonal weather extremes. I wouldn't call him a climate change activist or anything, but he does mention it in the context of formerly \"extreme\" weather events seemingly becoming \"the norm\" (for instance, before 2005 there had never been more than one category five Atlantic hurricane in one year, but since 2005 we've had I think four or five years when this has been the case, including 2017). So he'd mention climate change in that context when relevant.\n\nLately, the comments section of this blog has been tweeted by Drudge Report a few times, and when it does, it tends to get very suddenly bombarded with political comments. On a normal day, this comments section is full of weather enthusiasts and contains almost no political discussion at all, but when it's linked by this conservative outlet, it suddenly fills up with arguments about climate change not being a real thing, and seemingly many followers of Drudge go to the blog specifically to engage in very random climate change arguments.\n\nWatching this over the last few months has got me thinking - what is it that an ordinary, average citizen conservative has to gain from climate change being ignored policy-wise? I fully understand why big business and corporate interests have a stake in the issue - environmentalist policy costs them money in various ways, from having to change long standing practises to having to replace older, less environmentally friendly equipment and raw materials to newer, more expensive ones. Ideology aside, that at least makes practical sense - these interests and those who control them stand to lose money through increased costs, and others who run non-environmentally friendly industries such as the oil industry stand to lose *massive* amounts of money from a transition to environmentally friendly practises. So there's an easily understandable logic to their opposition.\n\nBut what about average Joe, low level employee of some company, living an ordinary everyday family life and ot involved in the realms of share prices and corporate profits? What does he or she have to gain from opposing environmentalist policies? As a musician, for instance, if I was a conservative how would it personal inconvenience me as an individual if corporations and governments were forced to adopt environmentalist policies?\n\nIs it a fear of inflation? Is it a fear of job losses in environmentally unfriendly industries (Hillary Clinton's \"put a lot of coal miners out of business\" gaffe in Michigan last year coming to mind)? Or is it something less tangible - is it a psychological effect of political tribalism, IE \"I'm one of *these* people, and *these* people oppose climate policy so obviously *I* must also oppose it\"?\n\nAre there any popular theories about what drives opposition to environmentalist policies among ordinary, everyday citizen conservatives, which must be motivated by something very different to what motivates the corporate lobbyists?","This decision is being met with harsh criticism from\nboth sides of the aisle, including Sens Chuck Schumer (D), Sherrod Brown (D) Cory Booker (D), John McCain (R), and Lindsey Graham (R).

He was a national champion debater in high school so he could add a wrinkle or two if he makes it there.","Prior to Trump's presidency I think a lot of Americans believed that the US system was imperfect, but at the very least, robust. However, looking back at the prior 25 years, I think it's difficult to argue that we haven't witnessed a deterioration in the health of our system. At this point it's a platitude that many of the institutions relating to the presidency rely on unwritten convention and \"normal order\" to function properly, or even at all. But the change has not just been at the top. The now-widespread practice of \"constitutional hardball\", now practiced by both Republicans and Democrats, has led to new norms in government. The term, [as coined by Mark Tushnet](https:\/\/scholarship.law.georgetown.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1557&context=facpub), is defined as follows:\n\n> [Constitutional hardball] consists of political claims and practices-legislative and executive initiatives-that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. It is hardball because its practitioners see themselves as playing for keeps in a special kind of way; they believe the stakes of the political controversy their actions provoke are quite high, and that their defeat and their opponents' victory would be a serious, perhaps permanent setback to the political positions they hold.\n\nTaken to its extreme, constitutional hardball can paralyze the government or lead to systemic collapse. What I'm interested in is the actual provisions in our system that can be exploited and lead to this collapse when not used in good faith. There are some examples that are common and to which we are now accustomed:\n\n1. The Hastert rule, where no no legislation can advance without one party controlling all houses of government and the presidency\n1. Gerrymandering, where one party can entrench a systemic advantage by controlling district lines\n1. The executive declining to enforce certain laws at the federal level\n\nHowever, there are more creative and radical mechanisms that no side has yet used in the modern era and are technically allowed under our system:\n\n1. Raising the number of supreme court seats and packing the court with partisan judges\n1. Gerrymandering state lines themselves by splitting reliably red or blue state to boost the number of Senators in that camp\n1. The use of blanket pardons by the executive to effectively nullify certain dully passed laws\n\nThe more of these become common practice, the weaker and more unrepresentative our government becomes, until it collapses; at a certain point, if institutional advantage is so entrenched on one side or another, it becomes a legitimate question as to whether the country wants to remain whole, and there can be literal revolution.\n\nMy question is, are there others points of failure? What are the major legal provisions in our system that are highly exploitable, and could lead to entrenchment of unfair advantage to one side, paralysis, or systemic failure if completely exploited?","Americans tend to like healthcare.

The broad thinking seemed to be that the party needed to change its internal structure, soften its tone, embrace more liberal stances on certain issues, and enhance its ground game in minority communities. Specifically some of the proposals were:\n\n- backing \"comprehensive immigration reform\"\n\n- \"If Hispanic Americans hear the GOP doesn't want them in the U.S.A., they won't pay attention to our next sentence. It doesn't matter what we say about education, jobs or the economy. If Hispanics think we don't want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.\"\n\n- \"needs to do better with women\" and it needs to address the \"unique concerns\" women voters have\n\n- extensive list of ways to reach out to voters of color, including recruiting candidates and outreach to universities, especially a \"strong focus\" on historically black colleges.\n\nOne presidential election cycle later, the GOP has basically done none of this. President Trump ran (and won) on a very strict platform of closing our borders to illegal immigrants and building a wall. Trump's share of women voters (42%) fell compared to Romney's (44%). The GOP's nomination of Mike Pence as VP indicated it was unwilling to soften its stance on religious conservatism and gay rights. The GOP has made no inroads nor spent any serious funding in outreach with minority voters.\n\n... and yet, despite the post-mortem calling for the opposite of each one of these policies, the GOP is in the strongest position it has been for decades, with unilateral control of all 3 branches of the federal government, a majority of governorships and a majority of state legislatures.\n\nWith this in mind, how did the writers of the post-mortem analysis get it so wrong?

If Trump wins the nomination but his party has assumed he will lose the general, then I'd guess their obstructionism would end.

States could opt out if they created a different paid leave system.\n\n>Still, the approach would put the burden of funding the program on the states. It also could mean that the benefits could vary greatly by location. Democrats have proposed more expansive programs with different funding streams.

Currently consisting of 23 government officials, they are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate (with the exception of the Vice President and Chief of Staff).  The Cabinet's purpose is to serve as an advisory body to the President.  Its authority is derived from Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.\n\nThe Cabinet currently consists of 23 members: The Vice President, the 15 heads of the Executive Departments, and 7 other officials.  The first (and smallest) Cabinet of George Washington consisted of four positions (the Secretaries of State, Treasury, War, and the Attorney General.  The Vice President was not considered a part of the cabinet until the mid 20th century.)  \n\nThe largest Presidential cabinet in US History existed from January 2017 to December 2018, with 24 Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials (Upon the resignation of Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations, President Trump demoted the position to [no longer be of Cabinet-level](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/white-house\/un-ambassador-no-longer-be-cabinet-level-position-n945356)). \n\nWhile public perception often sees Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions as either unchanging or simply a growing list, the reality is that while the Cabinet currently consists of 23 positions, a total of 33 positions have, at some point in American history been of Cabinet-level rank ([Here is a graph showing the timeline of the composition of the US Cabinet](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cabinet_of_the_United_States#\/media\/File:Top_Left_Cabinet_Image.png)).\n\nSince WWII, as every elected President since Truman has either added or removed at least one Cabinet or Cabinet-level position, the composition of the President's Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials have become more and more politically relevant, with discussions of what positions should make up the President's Cabinet often taking active roles in Presidential campaigns.  A notable example of this is Jimmy Carter famously promising to not appoint anyone to the Cabinet-level positions of 'Chief of Staff' and 'Counselor to the President.'  More recent examples leading into the 2020 election include: [Donald Trump proposing the consolidation of the Departments of Education and Labor](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/ed\/2018\/06\/21\/622189097\/white-house-proposes-merging-education-and-labor-departments), [Elizabeth Warren proposing the Department of Commerce and the cabinet-level Small Business Administration being merged](https:\/\/medium.com\/@teamwarren\/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7) into a single 'Department of Economic Development,' and Andrew Yang proposing a [Department of Technology](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/policies\/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies\/).\n\nTopics for discussion:\n\n\\- What positions should (or should not) be in the President's Cabinet?  (For the sake of discussion, I am counting Cabinet-level officials as equal to the core Cabinet, although there are small bureaucratic distinctions).\n\n\\- The power and influence of the Cabinet has waxed and waned between Presidential Administrations.  How important should the Cabinet be to the President going into the future?  How much political power should the Cabinet actually have?\n\n\\- What should the ideal size of the Cabinet be?  Is there even such a thing as an ideal size of the Cabinet?","Before Mueller's statement on 5\/29\/19, the [May Quinnipiac](https:\/\/poll.qu.edu\/national\/release-detail?ReleaseID=2618) poll showed 57% of voters say Trump committed crimes before he became president - yet only 29% support the beginning of the process to impeach.\n\n...which leads to the real question is now the most strategic time to begin the process of impeachment?\n\nArguments I have heard for and against starting the process now:\n\n**Impeach now**\n\n* There is a strong legal case for impeachment laid out in the 10 incidents involving Trump that Mueller outlined related to potential obstruction of justice. These constitute High Crimes and Misdemeanors which are grounds for impeachment and enough evidence to begin the formal process.\n\n* It is congress' legal and moral obligation to hold those who have committed crimes accountable, and as such congress has a duty to act now. Congress needs to show it is not ok for a president to attempt political interference in law enforcement functions.\n\n* Democrats risk discouragement among their base. After a historic midterm (8.1% spread between Democrats and Republicans was a larger percentage differential than in any recent wave midterm), the Blue Wave could lose momentum into 2020 if the house fails to impeach\/waits too long.\n\n* Support for impeachment can build when the process is formally initiated. It doesn't matter that the majority of the public (May Quinnipiac) do not support beginning impeachment. Look at Watergate... the impeachment process against Richard Nixon was formally initiated on February 6, 1974 at the time 38% of the public supported impeachment. By July 27, 1974, when the Committee voted 27\u201311 on the first article of impeachment, enough evidence had been released so that support was up to 57%\n\n**Wait to Impeach (or don't)**\n\n* Trump\u2019s attempts at obstruction do not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, and Mueller was not able to provide enough evidence to show conspiracy to defraud the US by Trump therefore this may be seen as a waste of time and political grandstanding by swing voters (don't impeach).\n\n* There are 14 Democratic-led House committees investigating various aspects of President Donald Trump' investigations into his finances, his taxes, his involvement in security clearances, etc. These impeachment proceedings could centralize all Trump-related investigations under the House Judiciary Committee. If the another committee, such as Financial Services, later uncovers it may have less of an impact because democrats already \"failed\" at impeachment (when the Senate blocks it). These investigations should be given time to uncover potential additional articles of impeachment and timelines provided so an overall impeachment strategy can be developed.\n\n* Timing - ultimately results matter; the only way Trump is removed from office is by vote on Nov 3 2020. Beginning almost a year and a half out may not be as impactful.

What should Trumps response be to this? Ignore it or attack them for going against the Republican nominee?","I've noticed that there is a large amount of support (particularly among Democrats) to adopt a popular vote or proportional vote system for the electoral college.  The idea behind this is system: one person, one vote.  The electoral college is composed of the total number of state representatives (House+Senate) - they vote for the President.  And their vote is determined by how the whole state votes (usually in a winner-take-all system).  This creates disproportionate power for people in small states compared to those living in large states.  And while this system is difficult to change - the primary system, which is determined by the parties themselves is not so much.  Currently, the Democratic party follows a similar setup as the electoral college - assigning delegates instead of using popular votes.  The formula for delegate allocation is as follows:\n\nTotal Delegates = 3,200 \\* 0.5 \\* ((State's Total Democratic Vote\/Country's Total Democratic Vote)+(State's Average Electoral Vote\/538))\\*1.15+Bonus Delegates+Unpledged Delegates\n\nThis formula is neither geared towards democratic ideals (one person, one vote) nor is it strategic in the sense of yielding the best candidates for the general election.  Instead, it creates favorable conditions for states who vote late (largely has benefited safe blue states), states who hold their primaries together (largely has benefited safe red states), states who are safe blue states, and party insiders (superdelegates).

But just before today's triple play of stories damaging to his administration, he was already taking on a bit of water, even among voters from his own party.\n\n>The Reuters\/Ipsos tracking poll, which has surveyed about 700 Republican voters every day since Trump's inauguration, shows that between May 11 and yesterday, his five-day average approval among Republican voters sank from 83 to 75 percent. Republican disapproval of Trump rose by exactly the same eight points \u2014 from 15 to 23 percent. Moreover, Wednesday and Thursday appear to have been the worst two days in the sample. This erosion of partisan supporters suggests that this week's troubles in the White House are more than just an inside-the-Beltway freakout.\n\n>The new numbers mark the highest level of Republican disapproval of Trump since his inauguration, at least in this poll. And it comes before breaking news stories that Trump disparaged James Comey in a meeting with Russian officials and said his firing takes \"great pressure\" off him \"because of Russia; that a current White House official is a person of interest in the Russia probe; and that the Russia probe includes an investigation of whether White House officials conducted a cover-up.\n\n\n1. Is this a sign for concern for the GOP and President Trump? What can be done to remedy this?\n\n2. If this ends up being a long term trend, will the Republican Party leadership start to abandon President Trump? What would that look like or entail?","After failing to secure his seat in South Thanet in 2015, yet remaining leader before going on to become represent the successful pivot of the British public towards Brexit, Nigel Farage has stepped down as leader of his party. \n\nHe has claimed that he has achieved his political goals. \n\nIs anything else going on here?

Combining ideas from the Heritage Foundation and the text of Ronald Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address, the Contract detailed the actions the party promised to take if they were elected to a Congressional Majority. Many political scholars have cited the Contract with America as the reason behind not only GOP taking back the United States House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, and while many of its reforms failed to pass or be implemented, it remained an effective political manifesto for the modern perception of the GOP's goals.\n\nThe contract's text included a list of eight proposed reforms, and ten proposed bills. These proposals were all limited to policies that polling showed garnered 60% support of the public, aka: \"60% issues.\" The goal was for the Contract to avoid controversial issues like abortion and school prayer.\n\nThe 8 Procedural Reforms:\n\n* require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply to Congress;\n* select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;\n* cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third;\n* limit the terms of all committee chairs;\n* ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;\n* require committee meetings to be open to the public;\n* require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;\n* guarantee an honest accounting of the Federal Budget by implementing zero base-line budgeting.\n\nThe 10 Bills:\n\n* The Fiscal Responsibility Act - An amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget unless sanctioned by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress\n\n* The Taking Back Our Streets Act - An anti-crime package including greater emphasis on prison construction and law enforcement funding.\n\n* The Personal Responsibility Act - An act to discourage teen pregnancy by reforming and cutting cash welfare and related programs.\n\n* The American Dream Restoration Act - An act to create a $500-per-child tax credit, add a tax credit for couples who pay more taxes in aggregate if they are married than if they were single.\n\n* The National Security Restoration Act - An act to prevent U.S. troops from serving under United Nations command and to cut U.S. payments for UN peacekeeping operations, and to establish guidelines for the integration of former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO.\n\n* The Common Sense Legal Reform Act - A tort reform bill, designed to institute \"Loser pays\" laws that weakening of product-liability laws to prevent litigation against companies for product failures.\n\n* The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act - A package of small-business incentives including capital-gains cuts and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment\/cost-benefit analysis, etc.\n\n* The Citizen Legislature Act - An amendment to the Constitution that would have imposed 12-year term limits on members of the US Congress (i.e. six terms for Representatives, two terms for Senators).\n\n* Family Reinforcement Act - Tax incentives for adoption, strengthening the powers of parents in their children's education, stronger child pornography laws, and elderly dependent care tax credit.\n\n* Senior Citizens Fairness Act - Raise the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance.\n\n\nIn 2018 the Democrats stand a very real chance of taking back the House, but much like in 2006, there is no party manifesto outlining what a Democratic majority would actually do if they achieve a Congressional majority.

Earlier this year, Trump cut the budget for the Census Bureau even more. An *accurate* 2020 census, however, is estimated to cost much more than the 2010 census. The Director of the Census Bureau resigned, and a replacement has not been nominated.\n\nAll of this seems to be culminating to a wildly inaccurate 2020 census.

A lot of it seemed to focus on the idea of a values\/ideological test:\n\n> Trump vowed to \"temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\" until the US can improve its vetting process for travelers from those countries.\nTrump also proposed a more stringent immigration test for admission into the United States, suggesting an ideological standard for entry to ensure that the US only admits \"those who share our values and respect our people.\"\n\"In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is long overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting,\" Trump said. \"Our country has enough problems.

A main idea of this theory is that large swaths of the country are rebelling against \"coastal elites\" and the associated liberal culture. \n\nI'm sure there are other arguments out there, including a mix of those offered above and completely different ideas.\n\nWhich theory best describes why Democrats lost so unexpectedly in 2016 and where Democrats need to go from here?

Many took this stance -- Bernie Sanders is one [example](http:\/\/www.wbur.org\/politicker\/2016\/11\/21\/bernie-sanders-berklee):\n\n> \"The working class of this country is being decimated \u2014 that's why Donald Trump won,\" Sanders said. \"And what we need now are candidates who stand with those working people, who understand that real median family income has gone down.\"\n\nBut more recently, especially after Charlottesville, the NFL protests, and Puerto Rico, the argument that Trump's election was about cultural (and most specifically racial) resentment seems to have gained ground. This argument was most prominently put forward by Ta-Nehisi Coates in the [article](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2017\/10\/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates\/537909\/) \"The First White President.\" Coates specifically rebuts the economic argument:\n\n>  The focus on one subsector of Trump voters\u2014the white working class\u2014is puzzling, given the breadth of his white coalition. Indeed, there is a kind of theater at work in which Trump\u2019s presidency is pawned off as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning. The motive is clear: escapism. To accept that the bloody heirloom remains potent even now, some five decades after Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down on a Memphis balcony\u2014even after a black president; indeed, strengthened by the fact of that black president\u2014is to accept that racism remains, as it has since 1776, at the heart of this country\u2019s political life. The idea of acceptance frustrates the left. The left would much rather have a discussion about class struggles, which might entice the white working masses, instead of about the racist struggles that those same masses have historically been the agents and beneficiaries of. Moreover, to accept that whiteness brought us Donald Trump is to accept whiteness as an existential danger to the country and the world. But if the broad and remarkable white support for Donald Trump can be reduced to the righteous anger of a noble class of smallville firefighters and evangelicals, mocked by Brooklyn hipsters and womanist professors into voting against their interests, then the threat of racism and whiteness, the threat of the heirloom, can be dismissed. Consciences can be eased; no deeper existential reckoning is required.\n\n\nOf these two forces, which do you think played a greater role in Trump's election? Why? Have your views on this changed over time?\n\n","This is being reported by Politico, but the Clinton camp has not responded to requests for comment. \n\nBiden was on the senate foreign relations committee as a senator and was picked by Obama partly for his experience in foreign policy. Biden and Clinton often disagreed on what to do while she was Secretary of State, however. She took a more hawkish position on issues while he urged caution. \n\nSo again, what are the odds this will happen and would he be an effective Secretary of State?","[As seen here.](http:\/\/kfor.com\/2016\/05\/20\/gov-fallin-vetoes-bill-that-would-make-performing-an-abortion-a-felony\/amp\/)\n\nWhat do you think her reasoning behind this was? What impact will this have on future bills like this, as well as Oklahoma politics?","In 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Jeff Sessions requested that the Census Bureau, which is overseen by the Commerce Department, incorporate into the 2020 census a question on citizenship status. The question and response options read as follows:\n\n>**Is this person a citizen of the United States?**\n\n>\u2022 Yes, born in the United States.\n\n>\u2022 Yes, born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas.\n\n>\u2022 Yes, born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents.\n\n>\u2022 Yes, U.S. citizen by naturalization (add year).\n\n>\u2022 No, not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe response options do not ask for additional information from someone who selects \"No, not a US citizen.\"\n\n\n**Proponent's Arguments:**\n\nThe Trump Administration and the DOJ state that the more granular data allowed by the addition of this census question would be useful in enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination against any citizen\u2019s voting rights on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, as minority communities (drawn as majority-minority districts using census population counts) may not be able to elect their preferred representatives if the district is made up of non-citizens and thus, ineligible voters. \n\nThe Administration argues that citizenship status was asked from the 1860s through 1950, when it was dropped on the standard census form, and that this is simply a reinstatement of gathering that information on the census. Citizenship questions are asked in other demographic surveys, as well.\n\n**Opposition's Arguments:**\n\nOpponents of the question, however, dispute that this information would be useful in enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and argue that immigrant communities, particularly households with people in the country illegally, will be less inclined to participate in the census if they have to identify family members who are not U.S. citizens. Some organizations project that the inclusion of the question [could lead to the worst undercount of black and latino communities in 30 years](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/06\/04\/728034176\/2020-census-could-lead-to-worst-undercount-of-black-latinx-people-in-30-years). Opponents also argue that this is a politicization of the census.  \n\n**Supreme Court Case**:\n\nThe fate of the citizenship question being added to the census may largely depend on the current [Supreme Court case](https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/18\/18-966\/91015\/20190306200050307_18-966tsUnitedStates.pdf), which is set to be ruled on by the end of this month. The case does not deal with the legality of the specific question, but rather the legality of the manner to which the question was added. Plaintiffs argue that the Department of Commerce violated the law by not providing Congress with all required reports related to the upcoming survey. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross denies this and claims they have complied with all regulations.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\nShould there be a citizenship question on the 2020 census? Do you agree with the Trump Administration that the data of of this question would be useful? Do you agree with opponents who state this could lead to an undercount of minorities? Are you concerned if it does lead to an undercount? Does the historical precedent of citizenship based questions on past censuses affect your opinion? Do you believe the SCOTUS will rule in favor of the DoC? Do you believe this question to be a politicization of the census? \n\n**Articles for further reading:**   \n\nhttps:\/\/www.tbf.org\/blog\/2018\/march\/understanding-the-census-citizenship-question-debate\n\nhttps:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/how-the-citizenship-question-could-break-the-census\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/article\/2019\/apr\/01\/citizenship-question-census\/\n\nhttps:\/\/thehill.com\/regulation\/court-battles\/446767-doj-fires-back-at-allegations-over-gop-strategists-role-in-census","The current U.S. President is the oldest President to have taken office in the nation's history.

It currently has ~$14.6 billion in unpaid bills, a current deficit of $6 billion, and $130 billion of unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nThe lack of a budget has been financially devastating for Illinois. Just in the beginning of this month, [S&P downgraded Illinois to BBB-](http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/06\/01\/reuters-america-sp-cuts-illinois-credit-rating-to-one-notch-above-junk.html), which is one notch away from junk. There is also the very real possibility that [there will be no roadwork being done](http:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/politics\/no-illinois-budget-could-mean-no-roadwork-idot-says\/2102138\/) without a budget. [Even lotteries are pulling out](http:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/news\/powerball-mega-millions-to-drop-illinois-due-to-states-budget-crisis\/) if no budget is in place, as the state wouldn't be authorized to make payments to them.\n\nFor years, the elephant in the room has been all of the unfunded liabilities accumulated by public pensions. Illinois has attempted to hike taxes numerous times to try to get pensions funded, but they are still hundreds of billions of dollars in the hole. [People are also leaving Illinois in droves](http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/local\/breaking\/ct-illinois-population-decline-met-20161220-story.html), which further compounds the situation. [And this exodus includes Chicago as well.](http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/local\/breaking\/ct-chicago-census-population-loss-met-20170322-story.html) To make matters worse, Illinois's state constitution guarantees that all pension obligations must be paid out in full. Even if Illinois somehow transitioned to a \"Public employees get a 401k like the rest of us\" system that is commonly advocated by conservatives, it does nothing to address all of the massive pensions and benefits that came before that. And of course such a change wouldn't be welcomed by Mike Madigan, the infamous Speaker of the House for Illinois's state legislature.\n\nI don't see how Illinois can actually get out of this hole. Even if they somehow pass a budget in the 11th hour their financial situation will likely continue to deteriorate as people continue to leave the state and they are crushed to death by all the unfunded liabilities that continue to pile up at such an astonishing pace.","There have been a few higher profile actions that I've heard about.\n\n* Trump's EO to not enforce collection of penalties from not participating in the ACA\n\n* Rubio and others getting rid of the temporary loss reimbursements for insurance companies (risk corridor provision) leading to companies pulling out of exchanges\n\nAre there other actions that could be coming to force the ACA to become unsustainable?

Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!\n\nThe comparison is already being made to Trump's \"appreciate the congrats\" tweet after the Orlando shooting, which seemed to hurt him among many voters for the way he seemed callous in response to tragedy. \n\nThis joins Trump's week and change of reaching out to the black community in ways that have caused as much trouble for him as they've helped. Media outlets noted that his outreach to blacks happened in white neighborhoods and to white crowds. His \"What do you have to lose?\" comment seemed to many to be essentially negging the black community, and some raised objections at the dismal view of black America he claimed. \n\nThe whole attempt of Trump to look better on the issue of race has also opened up a Clinton attack on him\u2014Clinton made her speech linking him to the alt-right, and released ads showing KKK members and other white nationalists endorsing his candidacy. \n\nTrump has a real problem with African American voters.

Trump is not trying to get AA to vote for him as much as get white moderates to not think he's racist.

Is Trump's attempt at proving he's not a racist having its intended effect? Should he keep trying?

On one hand, the Democrats could be seen as overplaying their hand, especially in light of the narrative being worked by Trump and the Republicans. Specifically stating that \u2018there was no conclusion of collusion or obstruction by Mueller\u2019. On the other hand, Democrats have read into the section of Mueller\u2019s report outlining the acts of *attempted obstruction* by Trump, and are calling for investigations and\/or impeachment proceedings into President Trump on the basis of these findings.

They controlled the governorship almost continually from 1967-1999, as well as holding power in state houses. On the national level, California (an important state because of its large share of electoral votes) was competitive for both parties through the 20th century, being won by Republicans several times; both Nixon and Reagan were from the state. As well as sending Republican representatives in the House and Senate to Congress.\n\nHowever their fortunes have been on the decline since the 90s. Slowly the tide has almost completely turned - the GOP currently holds 0 statewide offices and in fact has not held any since 2006, when Schwarzenegger was elected governor. In fact the GOP has not even had a seat a the table when it comes to the \"jungle primary\" system for the last two cycles - Democrats have essentially competed against each other for the governorship. 0 national Senators. Only 7 out of 53 House of Representative seats are held by Republicans. \n\nWhat are the reasons for this? And what (if anything) should the state and national GOP do to reverse the situation?

Gary Johnson and Bill Weld are being interviewed - Weld randomly began talking (unprompted; he was asked about transgender rights) about Hillary Clinton's emails. He said the following:\n\n>Weld: \"I'll give you one more news tidbit. All this stuff about Secretary Clinton's email accounts and the report that came out and how she might get indicted - I'm not buying. And I used to be the head of the criminal division of the justice department of the United States.\"\n\n>Reporter: \"What's that mean - '*not buying*'?\"\n\n>Weld: \"I'm not buying it. You can't indict somebody if there's no evidence of criminal intent and I don't see any evidence of criminal intent.\"\n\nSomewhat ironically, the interview had been interrupted by a phone call to MSNBC by Hillary Clinton - they stopped the Johnson-Weld interview to interview Clinton, then returned to interview Johnson-Weld, and this remark was near the end of the interview. Totally unprompted - he had just decided to talk about this after having answered a question relating to transgender rights (Weld said that he would sign any bill protecting transgender rights).\n\nWhat do you think this means? Why did Weld decide to weigh in on this? Do you think that the libertarians are attempting to cooperate with the Clinton campaign or something? It's possible that Weld is just talking about his genuine convictions, but then why should he bring it up randomly, unless he's just totally unable to stay on topic? It seems like a bad strategy to appeal to Sanders supporters, who just want to see some Clinton blood.\n\n**Edit: The reason why I think this is interesting isn't because Weld thinks Clinton is innocent. The reason that this is interesting is because Weld brought it up totally unprompted, which makes me think that there might be some political calculation involved** (or Weld really just decided to randomly bring it up, which is possible as well, though a little silly).","This thread was inspired by recent research that I had done online regarding the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nWhen looking up the public perception of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement, it is amazing to see just how much Americans hated them:\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/AsteadWH\/status\/753647787804352512\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/forstudentpower\/status\/902889771927785473\n\nhttps:\/\/ropercenter.cornell.edu\/public-perspective\/ppscan\/62\/62011.pdf\n\nSeriously, King and the Civil Rights Movement were more despised than Black Lives Matter ever has been.  \n\nIf you listen to some of Martin Luther King Jr. less known speeches, he was obsessed with the idea of identity politics that pundits today always cry about:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rizzwAHpDJs\n\n\"At the very same time that America refused to give the Negro any land,\" King argues, \"through an act of Congress our government was giving away millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest, which meant it was willing to undergird its white peasants from Europe with an economic floor.\" Building a full head of steam, King rolls his rhetoric down the track of just compensation for blacks by contrasting even more sharply the unequal treatment of the races in education, agriculture, and subsidies.\n\n\"But not only did they give them land,\" King's indictment speeds on, \"they built land grant colleges with government money to teach them how to farm. Not only that, they provided county agents to further their expertise in farming. Not only that, they provided low interest rates in order that they could mechanize their farms.\"\n\nKing links white privilege and governmental support directly to black suffering, and thus underscores the hypocrisy of whites who have been helped demanding that blacks thrive through self-help.\n\n\"Not only that,\" King says in delivering the death blow to fallacies about the black unwillingness to work, \"today many of these people are receiving millions of dollars in federal subsidies not to farm, and they are the very people telling the black man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps. And this is what we are faced with, and this is the reality.\"\n\nWith one final fell swoop, King reinforces his identification with the destitute, reiterates his belief that the government has failed in its fiduciary obligations to blacks, and subverts the stereotype of blacks shiftlessly waiting around for government cash by insisting that blacks deserve what is coming to them.\n\n\"Now, when we come to Washington in this campaign, we are coming to get our check.\" ","I have several family members and friends in California who are besides themselves with the election, some even wishing that California would secede.

As I understand it, this is the same system used by military stationed out of the country. I entered some information, checked some boxes on my browser, the ballot was saved as a PDF and I emailed it to my home county election officials. Another option was given to print the form, sign it, and mail it in. Voters can also request that the ballot be mailed to them.

If so, how will they vote?\n\nEdit: As \/u\/TrainofThought6 has pointed out, the 2016 GOP platform states:\n\n\n\n>**The Territory of Puerto Rico** We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state. We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. territory, and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. Once the 2012 local vote for statehood is ratified, Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico\u2019s future admission as the 51st state of the Union. \n\nI feel as though this is being overlooked as it'd be much harder for Republicans to block a vote when their party's official stance is pro-statehood.\n\n","http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results\/2016\/04\/kasich-misses-oregon-deadline-222470\n\nI really don't get Kasich's strategy right now.

Politics is carved into pairs of opposites. How do we bring complexity back to political discussion?","The draft is 15,000 words and covers a lot of issues, so I'll do my best to condense it coherently and avoid a really big wall of text. From the Associated Press article:\n\n\nQuick Summary: \n\n>Democrats approved a draft of the party platform early Saturday that includes steps to break up large Wall Street banks, advocates for a $15 an hour wage and urges the abolition of the death penalty\n\nDefeated Sanders measures:\n\n>Supporters of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated measures pushed by Sanders' allies that would have promoted a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system, a carbon tax to address climate change and impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracking.\n\nTwo quoted Sanders supporters' reactions:\n\n>\"We lost some but we won some,\" said James Zogby, a Sanders supporter on the panel. \"We got some great stuff in the platform that has never been in there before.\" Added Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Sanders ally: \"We've made some substantial moves forward.\"\n\n**A very important thing to consider while analyzing this release:**\n\n>The platform is a statement of the party's values and positions on a wide range of issues. While it does not bind the Democratic nominee to specific policies, it serves as a guidepost for the party moving forward.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian Conflict:\n\n>The committee defeated an amendment led by Zogby that would have called for providing Palestinians with \"an end to occupation and illegal settlements\" and urged an international effort to rebuild Gaza.\n\n>The draft reflects Clinton's views and advocates working toward a \"two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict\" that guarantees Israel's security with recognized borders \"and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity.\"\n\nVague reference to Social Security:\n\n>The document calls for the expansion of Social Security\n\nThe $15 minimum wage:\n\n>referring to the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a \"starvation wage\"\n\n>Sanders' allies wanted the draft to specify that a $15 per hour minimum wage should be indexed with inflation. Clinton's side struck down that idea, noting the document included a call to \"raise and index the minimum wage.\"\n\nBreaking up big banks:\n\n>supports ways to prevent banks from gambling with taxpayers' bank deposits, \"including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall.\" Sanders wants to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Clinton does not, but says her proposed financial changes would cast a wider net by regulating the banking system.\n\nThe death penalty:\n\n>a call for the abolition of the death penalty\n\nThe TPP:\n\n>the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP\n\nSanders' reaction:\n\n>Sanders, in a statement, said he was \"disappointed and dismayed\" that the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP. But he was pleased with the proposals on Glass-Steagall and the death penalty - and vowed to fight on. \"Our job is to pass the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,\" he said.\n\nThat's everything laid out in the Associated Press article, so some very big questions arise:\n\n1) How much did Sanders' platform and movement affect this draft? It seems there are some very clear compromises.\n\n2) How will these compromises affect the centrists and far left that she's trying to court? Will the demographic (all and any of them) of her support change?\n\n3) Do you think this is the kind of thing the party needed to do to get Sanders' endorsement as he outlined it yesterday?\n\n4) What does this mean going forward going for the Democratic party? As in, there are some truly progressive measures and not so progressive measures in this draft, do you think this trend will continue and how?\n\n5) How will this affect voters when contrasted with Trump's extremism?

","No, I don't mean accusations of censorship. I mean the blatant and egregious misinformation floating about. I think that this level of discourse harms the general conversation around the TPP, as well ultimately as serving to delegitimize any legitimate grievances that come out surrounding the TPP when the text of the negotiations is released, by tarnishing the entire anti-TPP movement as \/r\/conspiracy-type loons, the kind that also protest G20 meetings and the WTO, ultimately leading to the TPPs inevitable passage in all twelve negotiating states. To further any kind of political discussion on the topic, I'd like to list some of the myths and legitimate grievances to serve as a basis of discussion.\n\n**Myth 1: Certain chapters of the TPP will remain secret for four years after the treaty is ratified**\n\nThis claim stems from the small description wikileaks attached to the leaked documents. Those documents will be classified for four years, yes. But they are only negotiating documents; that is, every document generated between the beginning of the negotiations and the end. The final agreement itself, however, will be public soon after negotiations have concluded.\n\n**Myth 2: The agreement will be rushed through the various parliaments**\n\nAs mentioned in Myth 1, the agreement isn't going to be secret. To build on that, it will also be public for months before there is even a vote to ratify. According to the Trade Promotion Authority (or 'fast track'), this is some 60-90 days after it is entered into congress, though in practice the agreement is usually released earlier. For Australia, there has traditionally been some 4-8 months that the agreement before it is ratified. The recent FTA with Japan (JAEPA) was public for four months before ratification. The FTA with the US (AUSFTA) was public for six months. I don't know about the system for other countries, but at least for those two, the agreement will not be rushed through.\n\n**Myth 3: Fast Track is undemocratic**\n\nCommon criticisms of Fast Track are that it is rushed through quickly without debate(dispelled in myth 2), and that the fact that Congress can't make amendments means it's undemocratic. The fact is that in an agreement with 12 other countries, fast track is a necessity to actually have pass any international agreements. If Congress did try and amend it, it will have to go back to negotiations to make it acceptable to other parties, the other parties will want changes, and then when they reach an agreement they'll take it back to Congress. Who will, by that time, have decided they want something else, or don't like some of the changes, or want to change the wording. Which means it has to go to negotiations again, and the other countries will want to change it in response to Congress' changes, and eventually they'll reach an agreement. It will go before congress once more, congress will want to change things, return to other parties, ad infinitum. You can quickly see why it would be impossible to get anything through.\n\n**Myth 4: ISDS allows companies to sue for lost profits**\n\nThis is a very reductive description of what ISDS does, presumably done for simplicities sake to explain a complex mechanism that exists in more than 3400 agreements agreements across the globe, including some 50 that the US is already party to, and has been around since 1959. ISDS doesn't allow a company to sue for 'lost profits'. It only allows companies to sue and win for the violation of any of the four fundamental protections of the investment protection chapter. This will be a simplification, but if I called you a pervert and you lost your job as a result, you wouldn't sue me for 'lost profits'. You'd sue me for defamation\/libel, and seek lost profits in damages. Similarly, companies can't sue in ISDS for 'lost profits', they can only sue for the violation of those protections, and can be awarded lost income as a result. I go into considerably more detail on the subject [here](http:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/worldnews\/comments\/3aokfu\/fracking_poses_significant_risk_to_humans_and\/cseoj4j).\n\n**Myth 5: The TPP is written by corporate lobbyists**\n\nAgain, this is an oversimplification. When forming any policy, it's important to get the input of various stakeholders to understand what the effects of certain provisions would be. The government isn't omniscient, they don't have knowledge about everything which is why they call in experts. For the USTR (US Trade Representative), this is done in the form of Trade Advisory Councils (TACs). There are many of these TACs on a range of issues, from a Chemicals TAC, to a Automotive TAC, etc. In these TACs, certain members of those industries are invited to take part under strict NDAs and security clearance to give input on whatever aspects of policy their advice is required. This might take the form of suggestions for what would help that sector enter foreign markets, to what regulations the other party has that are functionally equivalent, yet different (incurring costs on making foreign models), to high tariffs on their goods. Now, obviously these representatives are looking out for their own sectors interests, but it's important to note that the role of the USTR is to balance all the disparate views to try and find something that's *reasonable* and *practical*. \n\nIn addition to these industry TACs, there are also a number of committees formed of NGOs. There's the LAC, which is populated with members of trade and labour unions. There's TEPAC, which is populated with environmental NGOs and specialists. These all play a different role in helping the USTR come up with the best and balanced possible negotiation platforms for the US.\n\n**Myth 6: The TPP is negotiated in secret, and this means that it will be bad for us.**\n\nThis one is partially true and partially false. Almost all trade negotiations have been conducted in secret throughout history, by every country and for very good reason - namely to keep lobbying as far away from the process as possible. I don't think I can come up with a concise enough explanation for this post, so instead I'd like to direct you to [this post I made recently explaining the theory behind it](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/worldnews\/comments\/3aokfu\/fracking_poses_significant_risk_to_humans_and\/cseosy3). \n\n**Legitimate Grievance 1: There is not enough transparency and citizen engagement in the process**.\n\nThis is where the 'partially true' part of myth 6 comes in, and this is the biggest issue for me personally with these negotiations. Whilst there are token efforts on behalf of all parties for both of these such as fact sheets on the DFAT or the USTR website, or the occasional public consultations, this is clearly insufficient for the information age. A role model to look for in this case is the European Union's Directorate-General of Trade (DG-Trade). In their negotiations on TTIP, the EU has published it's [negotiating mandate](https:\/\/www.laquadrature.net\/files\/TAFTA%20_%20Mandate%20_%2020130617.pdf) (the mandate handed to negotiators on what to negotiate for), [how the EU would like to envision the final form of various chapters as well as justifications for certain aspects](http:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/press\/index.cfm?id=1230), recently [shelved negotiations on ISDS in TTIP following a public consultation](http:\/\/europa.eu\/rapid\/press-release_IP-15-3201_en.htm), and has [set up a contact point for public submission, queries, concerns and the like on TTIP](http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trade\/policy\/in-focus\/ttip\/have-your-say\/). I see no realistic reason why this could not be enacted by other countries.\n\n---\n\nThe discussion surrounding the TPP has been truly awful on Reddit. No one should be making value judgements on the negotiations until the text is actually released (whether for or against), as only then will we be in possession of all the facts of the matter. Easily dispelled myths and misconceptions frequently rise to the top on submissions about the topic and get regurgitated, ultimately harming the anti-TPP argument should the agreement be as egregious to the public interest as many people on here think it is. Instead of taking such a stance early, we should be discussing legitimate grievances with the process (such as the lack of transparency), or on the merits of the final agreement when it comes out itself.\n\nAnd to stem the inevitable accusations, I don't work for any company or government agency related to the negotiations, nor am I paid to do this. I'm not a shill, I'm just someone that studied and wrote a masters thesis a few years back on international trade negotiation and am tired of seeing bad arguments floating around. I'd just like to have a legitimate, unemotive, factual discussion about legitimate grievances about the process, and the final agreement itself.","Full trump quote: \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s rigged and I\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged, to be honest.

The only two types of ranked choice voting systems that are currently being used in governmental elections are instant-runoff voting (IRV), and single transferable vote (STV). STV is only used in multiple-seat races, as in, where a single vote decides the outcomes of multiple seats, as in therefore not relevant for this question. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**IRV:** IRV is used in single seat election where there are more than two candidates, and works in the following way. \u201cInstead of voting only for a single candidate, in IRV, voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's top choice. If a candidate secures more than half of these votes, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate in last place is eliminated and removed from consideration. The top remaining choices on all the ballots are then counted again. This process repeats until one candidate is the top remaining choice of a majority of the voters. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.\u201d (from Wikipedia - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Instant-runoff_voting)\n\n&nbsp;\n \nFor context, IRV is used in Australia at the federal and state levels, in the UK, New Zealand, and some cities (Oakland, CA from 2010-present, San Francisco, CA from 2004-present) in the US. It was also adopted by the US state of Maine as of the 2016 election, and will apply to races for Congress, Governor, and State Legislature from 2018 onwards.

He also has extremely low name recognition, but is generally well-received in Colorado with a 49-30 approval-disapproval rating. Although I couldn't find much on his platform, it seems he's trying to bring the same middle-of-the-road message from his governorship to the White House. That being said, is there room in the 2020 primary for another moderate old white guy in addition to Biden, Delaney, and Inslee (I guess he's actually pretty liberal, but demographic overlap remains), or is this just another longshot\/VP\/Cabinet bid?","When Scott Brown won the special election for Ted Kennedy's seat in early 2010, a lot of influential Democrats like chief of staff Rahm Emanuel advised President Obama to seriously scale back his efforts at comprehensive health reform, and just pass a smaller bill. Obviously the situation was a little different, because Brown's win gave the Republicans the 41st seat that they needed to break the Democrats' filibuster proof majority in the Senate. But the rationale for scaling back reform was that it was politically unpopular, as evidence by opinion polling and the results of a special election, where a Republican had won in a very liberal state.\n\nSo my question is: If Ossoff wins in Georgia, and especially if he wins by more than the polls are predicting, do you think Senate Republicans might decide to tap the brakes on health care reform? Combined with the fact that approval of the House bill is at about 20%, it seems that House and Senate Republicans in moderate districts would have to consider that they could be next to lose their own seats if they continue full steam ahead with the current healthcare reform bill.","At tonight's debate, Donald Trump indicated that he may not accept the results of the election.

I will keep you in suspense,\u201d the Republican nominee said at the third and final presidential debate here.\n\nIf Hillary wins the election and Trump does not accept the result, what then?

I thought it might be a good place to tell him how I feel about the government shutdown and how it is affecting me personally. So I posted that I was a veteran who depends on his monthly VA benefits and that he should support a clean CR to get the government running again since, as it stands now, I probably won't be getting paid next month. When I checked his page this morning, I found that my post has been deleted and I can no longer leave comments on his page. This appears to only affect me because he has a lot of supporters constantly leaving comments to \"hold the line\" and \"don't give in.\" I guess I should have expected this, given what is happening in DC right now, but I am still a bit dumbfounded that an elected representative of the people would blatantly attempt to silence the people who he represents if they don't see eye to eye with him. I don't care where you stand on the Affordable Care Act, but people should know that blocking public discourse on issues is about as un-democratic and un-American as you can get.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nApparently Facebook saves you comments even if they are removed from a page. \n\nFor those of you wondering if my posts on the Congressman's Facebook page were out of line was out of line, a redditor pointed out to me that my comments were probably still saved in my facebook activity. Sure enough, they are.\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/u6oxr37\n\nThe top portion was the post I was commenting on.

I censored the names of the other people, but you should be able to find the original comment still on the Congressman's FB page.\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\nJust a little update. I am now able to post on Congressman Fincher's FB page and one of my comments, the one above, has been un-hidden. Thank you all for the support and helping call this to attention. \n\nAlso, since the Congressman's Director of Communications and some of his supports want to imply that the \"issue was resolved.\" I wan't to address how I feel about this \"resolution.\"\n\nWhile I am able to post, I still don't feel that the issue was \"resolved.\" The issue was bigger than just my posts and my ability to post. The real issue is a constituent who the Congressman represents was banned from posting. I never received an explanation on why I was banned, so I must assume that it was for no other reason than disagreeing with the Congressman's views, as I didn't use profanity, say anything obscene, or anything that would go against their guidelines on posting. I find it insulting that the Director of Communications continued to imply that the only way I was banned was because I must have said something obscene or profane. \n\nI'm afraid that the issue can never truly be resolved. The only thing that can be done is for people to watch their elected representatives, and hold them accountable for their actions. I have learned through all of this that social media can be an amazing tool to achieve that accountability. I want to thank everyone who gave their opinions on the matter, and everyone who stepped up reposted this reddit thread to twitter and facebook.

A big aspect of these changing demographics is believed to be \"rural brain drain.\" Young people from small, economically ravaged are going to college. But instead of coming back home to invest in their hometowns with their newfound education and power, they end up moving to urban areas. 100% understandable, as those areas offer a lot more jobs, networking opportunities, entertainment, etc. But this is causing rural areas to suffer even more, as an entire generation of people continues to flee and leave their hometowns to rot.\n\nWhat can be done to put a plug on this phenomenon?

The momentum from being nominated as VP in 2012 was still there, he was the newly minted Speaker of the House (the most powerful Republican politician), and he was still young but experienced, and one of the better known Republicans who ran in the primary.

The field of candidates in the Democratic primaries in 2020 is likely to be large. There are already 30+ names being discussed as possible candidates. Not all of them will run, of course, but it is safe to say that there may be 10-15 serious candidates in the race by January 2020.\n2. Democrats assign delegates proportionally to the vote a candidate receives in a state rather than on a winner-take-all basis. Therefore, if there are several approximately-equally-popular candidates in the race, none of them are likely to emerge with a majority of delegates in a given state. If they all persist through the remaining primary states, it's quite possible that no candidate will go into the DNC with a majority of pledged delegates.\n3. The DNC [recently changed the rules](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/08\/25\/politics\/democrats-superdelegates-voting-changes\/index.html) on superdelegates so that they can no longer vote on the first ballot for the presidential nominee. This prevents superdelegates from prematurely ending the race by coalescing around a single candidate and \"stealing\" the race from a candidate that won a majority of pledged delegates. However, this also means that superdelegates will not be able to decide a race where no candidate has a majority until the *second* ballot of the convention.\n\nSo--do you agree that these rules make it likely the Democratic nomination comes down to the convention? Or, will voters ensure that the field narrows quickly by coalescing around a single candidate? What factors would make this more or less likely? Will superdelegates pre-commit themselves to their votes on the *second* ballot at the convention? And what would a brokered convention look like in the 21st century when conventions are usually highly scripted affairs?","In Poland and Turkey (as just two examples, there are endless more in today's world) there have been authoritarian parties and authoritarian individuals who came to power in democratic elections. There seems to be a pattern in a lot of democratic countries where people elect authoritarian parties and individuals, who then declare war on the tenets of democracy (free press, independent judiciary, balance of powers between legislative and executive, etc). \n\nI was once told by someone living in Egypt that in the middle east, one of the best ways to reduce support for Islamist ideologies was to let them win elections, then when the public saw what life under them was like, they'd vote them out. The public learned their lesson and went back to more mainstream parties. \n\nBut look what happened in Venezuela. The public elected Chavez, but then they elected an opposition party for the legislature so Chavez's party just neutered the legislature. The public elected authoritarian leaders, but once they were in power they acted on their authoritarian impulses so they couldn't be removed from power. \n\nIf the public in a democracy want authoritarian leaders, should they be allowed? Should democracy be strengthened so people can vote them out, or should the people just be stuck with authoritarian leaders? \n\nI tend to think that a strong constitutional democracy can withstand an authoritarian leader, but what happens when the people vote for them over and over again like in Poland or Turkey? If the people in Poland or Turkey vote over and over again for parties and individuals who declare war on democracy, should democracy be defended in those states? If so, how?

One the massive decrease in wealth seen in cities during the great recession, and comparatively minor drop seen in rural areas. This was followed by recovery in cities and not in rural areas. However given the trend line prior it seems to me that the recession rather than playing a role, simply laid clearer the underlying fundamentals or rural wealth, or the lack thereof. \n\nThe others were the more cultural ones looking at things divorce rates, crime rates, and birth rates in which it found the rural areas doing worse now than before, and putting them in a far worse position compared to cities to compete for talent. While small towns maintain less crime, the article found that their 'safety advantage' for families as nearly evaporated with the closing gap in violent crime with cities. \n\nSo my question is what, if anything, should be done to deal with the increasing unattractiveness of rural areas?

However, with a larger number of candidiates running, the 15% slice becomes harder and harder to achieve even for the front-runners.\n\nFor instance, right now [RCP averages](https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2020\/president\/ia\/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html) in Iowa have Buttigieg in the lead and then 3 candidates (Warren, Biden, Sanders) hovering just above the threshold of viability at around ~17%. This is within the margin of error of those polls - it is thus not inconceivable that on the day of the Iowa Caucus one or two or even all three of them might not reach viability. In that most extreme case, since the delegates can only be prorated to viable candidates, that would mean Buttigieg manages a winner-takes-all and wins 100% of the Iowa delegates.\n\n[New Hampshire polling](https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2020\/president\/nh\/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html) is seeing a similar thing with Sanders on the cusp of being viable and Warren, Biden, and Buttigeig barely above the polling error over the viability threshold. [South Carolina](https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2020\/president\/sc\/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html) is another case, where Warren is barely at the threshold - if she drops even a little bit there then it looks like a real possibility that Biden might be the only candidate that is viable and thus wins 100% of the delegates.\n\nThus, the combination of the number of candidates running and the 15% viability threshold could potentially shake up the race in dramatic ways.

The State Department has had \"loose\" security practices for decades and this issue with classified information in Clinton's emails might be a systematic problem. Thoughts?","In 1934, the United States federal government passed the [Indian Reorganization Act (IRA)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indian_Reorganization_Act?wprov=sfla1).  The centerpiece of the so-called \"Indian New Deal,\" the act is most well-known for establishing the modern bureaucratic apparatus used to govern Native American reservations.  While certain sections of the law have been challenged over the years by various groups, no aspect is more universally despised amongst Native Americans than the doctrine of Secretarial Review.\n\nUnder the IRA, whenever a tribal government seeks to pass a law of any kind, impose any tax, hold any referendum, or modify their constitution, the action must be presented to the United States Secretary of the Interior (currently [David Bernhardt](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Bernhardt?wprov=sfla1)) for approval. In accordance with the Act, the Secretary is free to approve or deny the request for any reason whatsoever. While reservations are technically allowed to challenge the decision of the Interior Secretary in federal courts, history shows a significant slant in favor of the Federal government. The courts routinely cite the 1889 US Supreme Court case *United States v Kagama* as precedent, with the case stating: \"The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell.\"  \n\nArguments in favor of Secretarial Review often revolve around a few key points:\n\n1. Native American Tribes used to be at war with the United States, and thus need their laws reviewed to make sure they don't conflict with the Constitution.\n\n2. Secretarial approval is more of a rubber stamp, as modern secretaries wouldn't want the bad press of denying the will of the people.\n\n3. All tribes were given the opportunity to opt-out of the law, and as such the people freely chose to adopt this system.\n\nOpponents of Secretarial Approval have made several arguments, including: \n\n1. Without Secretarial Approval, tribal governments are still required to follow the constitution, with federal courts still able to overturn Tribal laws which violate the US constitution.\n\n2. The possibility of having the Secretary of the Interior deny the implementation of a law effectively serves as a deterrent to passing certain laws, even if said laws enjoy majority support amongst the residents of the reservations.\n\n3. Most native Americans consider the elections which took place for tribes to opt out of the law as scam elections. In the vast majority of native American cultures, an abstention is counted as a 'no' vote. However, these referendums counted any tribal resident who did not show up to vote, yet was eligible to vote, as voting yes.  Despite then-Representative William Hastings (a member of the Cherokee nation) pointing this out as a potential cause for mass confusion amongst the Indian population to his colleagues in Congress, his warnings were ignored. Lack of notification, ballots being printed solely in English, and inconsistent requirements on who was allowed to vote, also served to cause mass confusion. Hastings appeared to have been vindicated in his belief, as a Chocktaw Leader said the day after the referendum \"90% of us did not show up, yet apparently 95% of us somehow voted for white tyranny.\"  \n\nFollowing the referendum, the whole ordeal was widely mocked by Native Americans, with the Indian Rights Association actually openly calling then Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs John Collier a Dictator. \n\nWith all this context, I pass off the question to this thread: Should Secretarial Review be abolished?  Should it simply be revised for the modern day, or is the system fine as it is?","All throughout the analysis of the 2016 Presidential election we've heard time and time again of the surge of support Trump got from rural, working class whites who never voted before that helped him win the presidency.

For example, according to Gallup, in 1975 21% of Americans believed that abortion should be legal under all circumstances, whereas the number is 28% today. Belief that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances went from 22% to 18% in the same time frame, and belief that it should be legal in some circumstances went from 54% to 50%.

It was partially enacted on 11 March 1981, fully effective as of 11 March 1990. It was amended considerably on 17 August 1989 (via referendum) and on 22 September 2005 (legislatively), and also in 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. It replaced the earlier constitution of 1925.\n\nAnd while we're at it, the section on legitimacy:\n\n>According to law professor Camel Cazor Aliste, the Constitution of 1980 has problems of legitimacy stemming from two facts. First, the writing commission was not representative of the political spectrum of Chile\u2014its members were hand-picked by the Pinochet dictatorship and opponents of the regime were deliberately excluded. Second, the constitution's approval was achieved through a controversial and tightly government-controlled referendum in 1980.[2]\n\n>Despite controversy about its conception, it has been frequently modified - nearly 20 times -since democracy was reinstated, with corresponding Parliamentary approval.\n\n\nAmid recent unrest in Chile, the legislature wants to use a new constitution as a tactic of reconciliation.\n\n[Per CNN](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2019\/11\/15\/americas\/chile-congress-constitution-protests-intl-hnk\/index.html)\n\n> Chile's Congress has reached an agreement to reform the country's constitution in an effort to restore peace after weeks of violent protests that have led to the deaths of at least 20 people.\n\n> The new constitution will seek a \"peaceful and democratic exit to the crisis,\" Chilean Senate President Jaime Quintana announced at a news conference in Santiago early Friday morning.\nQuintana said the new code would \"build a true social contract\" and be \"100% democratic\" compared to the current constitution, which was approved in 1980 during the rule of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nThat article is fairly recent; last week [protesters rejected plans to reform the constitution](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/11\/chile-protesters-reject-government-plan-rewrite-constitution-191111164719422.html) but since then there have been developments.\n\nAs to how a new constitution could actually change things, I get the sense they are going after textual guarantees in the constitution: [Source](https:\/\/www.latinpost.com\/articles\/142616\/20191117\/new-constitution-has-been-approved-by-the-chilean-congress.htm)\n\n>The president of Chile Sebastian Pinera promised that there will be economic changes and social changes in the construction of Chile's new Constitution to address multiple issues such as an increase in pension, cheaper medical insurance, a decrease in the price of medicine, and controlling electricity prices.\n\nThis makes me curious about the effects of the current constitution and what the protesters might find objectionable about it.","Per Brian Fallon\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/danmericaCNN\/status\/716289479879892992\n\nSeems Sanders campaign was offered three possible dates and refused them all.

Or, alternatively, should she start to raise her profile this week, and get out in front of any momentum Trump's \"new campaign\" might start to generate?  If so, how can she do this?

He says Democrats wouldn't be able to reliably count on his vote in the Senate, and foresees playing a role like that of Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who has broken with the GOP on several high-profile issues.\n\n>\"I think you can be influential being in that swing position,\" Bredesen said during an interview this past week in his campaign office in Nashville's West End neighborhood.\n\n>Bredesen represents the irony facing Democrats this fall. The party is moving to the left but its prospects of regaining the Senate hinge on decidedly moderate candidates running in states Trump carried by a wide margin.\n\n>With just over six weeks until Election Day, one of Bredesen's biggest challenges may be divorcing his race from Democrats' overall Senate chances.\n\n>\"A lot of conservatives in Tennessee really like Phil Bredesen and really don't want (New York Democratic Sen.) Chuck Schumer to be majority leader,\" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. \"How they wrestle with that tension likely determines the outcome of the Senate race.\"\n\nBredesen is not the only Democratic candidate who has exclusively campaigned on being a moderate (and sometimes, an outright conservative). Across the Midwest and South, Senate and House candidates have been explicitly positioning themselves away from the national party.\n\n[For example, at least 20 Democratic candidates for the House](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2018\/06\/20\/pelosi-democrats-candidates-midterms-655484) - including Conor Lamb who won a stunning upset a few months ago - have vowed to not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. If the House becomes blue but narrowly, this could pose a problem if they join Republicans in voting down Pelosi's nomination.\n\nCould we be seeing a resurgence of a strong conservative Democratic bloc within the party? The [blue dog Democrats](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blue_Dog_Coalition) are famous for being the most outspoken conservative wing of the party, but their numbers have shrunk - recently to only 15 members. With the coming election, could this become a significant faction?\n\nAnd finally, how will this play out with the base of the party? According to national polls, the Democratic base is growing increasingly leftwing.

OFA had no faith or confidence in the state parties so they created a whole separate organization, they took money away and centralized it in D.C. They gave us a great president for eight years, but we lost everywhere else.\"\n\nFormer South Carolina Democratic Chair Jaime Harrison: \"[OFA] created a shadow organization that was recruiting the same volunteers [as the DNC], using resources from a very limited number of donors, and therefore, as a result it weakened the DNC and the impact that the DNC and state parties could have on politics during [Obama's] tenure.\"\n\nThis is a unique perspective on the Democratic Party's woes that I had never really heard or considered before.

What do you think she should do?","On February 25th, after Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Nate Silver made a demographics based projection on which candidate had the advantage in which state. The article was called: [Bernie Sanders Doesn\u2019t Need Momentum \u2014 He Needs To Win These States](http:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/bernie-sanders-doesnt-need-momentum-he-needs-to-win-these-states\/)\n\nHis argument was that like 2008, the media would talk a lot about momentum of the candidates throughout the coming months. But like 2008 the reality would be that demographics would determine who won which state, and the illusion of momentum just an artefact of a candidate getting several favourable states in a row. He made a set of projections for how each state would go if the race was a 50\/50 tie, factoring in the demographic advantages of both candidates as shown in the first three primaries and the assumed Hillary landslide in South Carolina.\n\nI figured that if he was right, that means that now looking back his demographic projections from then should've by and large held up. So I copied Nate's numbers into excel, added the actual winners, and looked for the margin that made Nate's projections line up the closest with the actual end result:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/mOBCNIL\n\nThe result is that giving Hillary a 3% advantage over the 50\/50 margin ends up correctly predicting the winner 41 out of 47 times, or 87%. I chose to compare solely the projected winners, not Nate's projected margins against the actual margins, mostly for convenience. I think correctly predicting 87% of the primary winners based on the extremely limited demographics date of February 25 is plenty. (But if anyone wants to do the work of comparing projected-vs-actual margins please go ahead and report your results!)\n\nWe are starting to see Sanders' campaign postmortems now. I think this is an interesting question but I'm seeing a lot of these postmortems adopting the 'momentum' interpretation suggesting if only Sanders had done this or that to take advantage of his 'momentum' after winning this or that state he still could've pulled through. But I think the above shows that, while there might very well be things Sanders could've done in 2015, once the primaries started it was about demographics and the vast majority of states went as they were predicted to go way back in February.\n\nAnyone else agree, or disagree?

Business owners found in violation can be fined up to $10,000. The administration argues that the law wrongly hurts employers who are caught between efforts to perform what they see as a civic duty to cooperate with federal authorities, and the state, which penalizes such cooperation.\n\n- A law that limits when and how local jurisdictions may cooperate with immigration authorities. The Justice Department said it is challenging, in particular, a provision that restricts local officials from voluntarily providing information about when a suspected undocumented inmate will be released from custody, as well as a provision prohibiting the transfer of somebody to federal custody without a judicial warrant.\n\n- A law that bars local jails from contracting with the federal government to provide bed space for immigrants being held on civil immigration violations, although the provision being challenged deals with rules governing the inspection of these facilities.\n\nCA Governor Jerry Brown and AG Xavier Becerra (both Democrats) stand behind these statutes and do not believe they violate federal law or the US Constitution.\n\nDo you believe the federal government has a case against the constitutionality of these statues?

There's *no question* that the Senate has the authority to reject the president's nominees, while the president clearly has the authority to nominate a replacement as long as he's in office.\n\n2. The Senate has no real power to stop the president from nominating someone and forcing their hand.\n\n3. Stalling the vote on Obama's nominee until after the election would be historically unprecedented, almost tripling the previous record for the longest confirmation process. However, if they just keep rejecting his nominees, the vacancy wouldn't even be the longest in recent history.\n\n4. If they argue that the people should have an input on who the next justice is, the obvious response is that they did, in 2012. On the other hand, if they just reject his nominees, they can make the argument that they themselves were elected to advance and defend conservative values, which is exactly what they're doing.\n\n5. If they submit a short list of qualified conservative justices, or even a list of criteria they want a nominee to meet, they put the ball in Obama's court; in other words, if he continues to submit nominees he knows they won't accept, they can make the argument that *he* is the one who is being \"obstructionist\".\n\n6. Similarly, letting him know what replacements *would* be acceptable to them gives them a defense against anyone who claims they're opposing Obama just because he's Obama.\n\n7. If a Democrat wins this year's election, the argument about nominees in an election year completely falls apart.\n\n8. It wouldn't leave Republican candidates for president open to the obvious question of whether they'd refuse to nominate someone in an election year. If a vacancy opens on the Supreme Court when the Senate and the Presidency are controlled by opposing parties, *of course* the president is going to try to skew it in his direction, and *of course* the Senate is going to resist.\n\nTo me, it seems like the smartest thing for Republican Senators to do would be to not say anything until Obama actually nominates someone, reject a couple of his nominees, and then tell him exactly what kind of nominee they *would* approve, telling anyone who asks that they're just doing their job, and that they're not *obligated* to confirm his nominees.\n\nFrom a constitutional standpoint, they'd have a much stronger case based on separation of powers: if the president skews the Court towards him, it will be less capable of checking his power, and Senate had to approve any nominee, the president might as well just appoint justices directly.","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-in-talks-for-joint-campaign-appearance\/\n\n> Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is in talks with primary rival Bernie Sanders for a joint campaign appearance, a source confirmed to CBS News.

Famously, it was the only issue George Washington ever spoke up on during the Constitutional Convention- arguing that one Congressman in the House per 40,000 citizens was too few, and advocating one Congressman per 30,000 citizens instead- which was the original ratio adopted when the country was first founded.\n\nJames Madison, one of the most important authors of the U.S. Constitution, proposed the first-ever Constitutional Amendment to affix the ratio of Congressmen for all perpetuity.  In the first of 12 Amendments- 10 of which went on to become the Bill of Rights, he proposed:\n\n- 1 representative per 30,000 people until the number of Congressmen reached 100\n\n- 1 representative per 40,000 people until Congress grew to 200\n\n- 1 representative per 50,000 people thereafter (the Senate version initially had 60,000)\n\n\nHowever a last-minute change to the wording of the Amendment made it unclear exactly how many representatives there would be after 200 (changing a \"less\" to \"more\"), leading to significant controversy of the bill.\n\nIt actually eventually obtained 12 states' ratification (of the original 13, only Massachusetts, Georgia, and Connecticut failed to ratify)- and as it was discovered in 2011, Connecticut actually DID ratify- but failed to send notice to Congress (meaning the Amendment did not become law by historical accident).  Due to great debate over the bill, newly-admitted Kentucky also ratified the bill too late for it to become law at the time.\n\nWithout the Congressional Apportionment Amendment- which is still technically a pending Amendment before the states and could be revived at any time- Congress was free to determine its own size, and proceeded to make itself progressively more exclusive by reducing the representation ratio for the next 110 years, until capping its size altogether in 1929 at 1911 levels.\n\nToday, we have less than 1 representative per 750,000 people.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment\n\n\n---Recent History---\n\nThe size of the U.S. Congress has been fixed at 435 members since 1929, despite the population growing 2.7-fold in that time:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929\n\nhttps:\/\/www.census.gov\/population\/estimates\/nation\/popclockest.txt\n\nhttps:\/\/www.census.gov\/popclock\/\n\n\nIf the population had continued being represented at the same ratio today as in 1929, we would have 1175 Congressmen, not 435.\n\n\nWhat would readers think of enlarging the U.S. Congress and providing for its future growth in proportion to population?\n\nPlease discuss intelligently.","I come from a middle class family and those around me seem to complain that their insurance rates have increased dramatically due to Obamacare.

But HB 1523 does not honor that tradition of religion freedom, nor does it respect the equal dignity of all of Mississippi\u2019s citizens. It must be enjoined.\n\n>The State has put its thumb on the scale to favor some religious beliefs over others. Showing such favor tells non adherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and . . . adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community. And the Equal Protection Clause is violated by HB 1523\u2019s authorization of arbitrary discrimination against lesbian, gay, transgender, and unmarried persons. The plaintiffs\u2019 motions are granted and HB 1523 is preliminarily enjoined.\n\nHow this will end up working now:\n\n>The preliminary injunction will hold until any appeals are completed. Then, if upheld, they will be filed as permanent injunctions.\n\nSome background on the bill:\n\n>The bill, officially titled as the \u201cProtecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,\u201d was authored by state House Speaker Philip Gunn (R).\n\n>His resulting bill easily passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate.

Any private business owner could refuse service to anyone they perceived to be gay by citing the above religious beliefs.\n\nSo how far reaching is this going to be?

What will happen next?","The American Presidential Medal of Freedom was established in 1963 by JFK to honour individuals who have made \"an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, or world peace, or cultural or other significant public or private endeavors\".\n\nSome of the names on the list make sense, while I struggle to see the meritorious contribution made by others.  \\*\\*Who do you think is the second most absurd pick?\\*\\* (Recognising that Bill Cosby almost certainly wins this dishonour, but only in retrospect).\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List\\_of\\_Presidential\\_Medal\\_of\\_Freedom\\_recipients](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_recipients)","In recent years, considerable attention has been brought to the rise of \"fake news\" and other forms of misinformation within the media.

How would you communicate this process to a layperson and\/or those who already receive misinformation from, and have trust in, deceptive news sources?\n\n\n","President-elect Trump recently stated in an interview that he believes NATO is, \"obsolete.\" For the better part of his campaign he had made similar statements questioning the commitment of the European nations to the alliance, suggesting that they should pay for US protection, and generally questioning US involvement in the alliance.\n\nThe left, and most established foreign policy figures have reacted with strong opposition to reducing or ending America's role in the alliance, but there hasn't been much discussion of whether or not NATO still serves US interests.\n\nWith the US primarily committed to conflicts in the Middle East and to a lesser extent the Pacific, does NATO still serve the US as a means of protecting its strategic interests?\n\nEDIT: This post has been getting a lot of responses in the affirmative with no effort to examine WHY.
