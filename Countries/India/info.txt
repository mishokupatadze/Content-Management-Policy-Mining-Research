The censorship in India is mostly around the hot topics. Which are then turned into kill switches. 
A kill switch is a concept which disables the internet in certain parts of a country where the event 
is happening so that people cannot post on that topic from that particular region. 
To add onto this a particular set of keyword censorship is applied around the hot 
topic for a period of time, which is decided based on how long the topic remains under spot light. 

After these events are no longer in the spotlight the censorship is removed and the data
 is freely available and can be talked upon. Which leads to no set of particular keywords
 being banned always. But taking into account the latest happenings and the sensitive topics 
we have formulated a list of topics which are in the news and politics and formed a list of words.
 which revolve around the recent events.
