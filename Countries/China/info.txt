 hurl invectives, parody, threat, 'Title Party', hate and inciting" - this is only short but clear list of globally censored content. But there is another list,
 which contains ambiguous explanations of the topics such as "spreading 'bad lifestyle', 
spreading 'bad popular culture', 'non-mainstream view of love and marriage', 'the pessimistic outlook of millennials'" and etc.. Separate rules and much strict censorship 
is applied to political topics - nobody can speak about government in bad contest, as well as discuss their historical mistakes. Content under this topic is forbidden since 
it "breaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity", or that "may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability".
