Generally, Russian government puts a lot of limitations and restrictions on the web content in the name of fighting "extremism" and protecting its own people (Freedom of the net report). The list of topics include: "child pornography, the illegal sale of alcohol, illegal drugs and drugs use, illegal gambling, calls for suicide, calls for extremist activities, riots, or unsanctioned protests, violations of copyright, violations of data protection legislation, defamation, information about skirting online censorship, anticorruption campaigning, certain religious groups, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses and LGBT+ rights" [https://www.freedomonthenet.org/country/russia/freedom-on-the-net/2019#B]. Our particular interest for this research (as we cannot cover all of the restricted topics) is, firtly, information that has been blocked in general about the topic, such as content on drug usage and LGBT-related content. We also consider information that has been blocked as "related to extremist and terrorist activities" (although this term is extremely underspecified and has been applied to various precedents - from posting a nazi symbol to accusing government of Crimea annexation), calls for suicide and violence towards certain groups of people and expressing hate towards state symbols and government representatives. The problem of ambiguity in content moderation resulted in increase in self-censorship as well as increased usage of sarcasm and satire, double meaning and metaphors in social media : "The vague wording of laws that touch on online expression, the arbitrary manner in which they are enforced, and the general ineffectiveness of judicial remedies make ordinary users more reticence to express themselves online." (Freedom of the net report). This issue has also made us put certain restrictions on the keyword collection:
1. It is impossible in the scope of research to cover all synonyms and examples of the expression of certain expressions, therefore, we use the common wording that has precedents of blocking, or generally expresses the topic being moderated;
2. Blocked materials cannot be published again, therefore, we reference to them, but not use the exact wording;
3. Hatespeech can be expressed in limitless number of ways, at first we collected hate keywords using Hatebase algorithm, however, hate towards general groups of people (based on race, gender, religion etc.) is restricted in all countries of our interest, during keyword normalization we remove them as they do not affect the final results.

Every topic that we choose for research has precedents of blocking, the full list of keywords and references on precedents is listed in the Appendix.
