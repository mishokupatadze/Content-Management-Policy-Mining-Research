This is pretty much the biggest red-alert towards legal nootropics in the US.,1240,8r7ipn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8r7ipn/this_is_pretty_much_the_biggest_redalert_towards/,468,1529058254.0,"So essentially, there’s this bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. It gives the DEA and the attorney general almost completely unchecked power to schedule any drug they see fit without following the currently established legal criteria to ban certain substances. In Section 2, Subsection 3B of the bill, this is the most worrying part that affects many different nootropics from phenibut to adrafinil or even kratom or tianepetine. 

“6)Schedule A
(A)In general
The drug or substance—

(i)has—

(I)a chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(II)an actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(ii)is not—

(I)listed or otherwise included in any other schedule in this section or by regulation of the Attorney General; and

(II)with respect to a particular person, subject to an exemption that is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption.


(B)Predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect
For purpose of this paragraph, a predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system may be based on—

(i)the chemical structure, structure activity relationships, binding receptor assays, or other relevant scientific information about the substance;

(ii)

(I)the current or relative potential for abuse of the substance; and

(II)the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution, or diversion from legitimate channels, of the substance; or

(iii)the capacity of the substance to cause a state of dependence, including physical or psychological dependence that is similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V. “


This is concerning due to Phenibut having a similar pharmaceutical effect to Lyrica (schedule V) nd also being able to be (A) abused, and (B) can cause addiction or dependence similar to benzodiazepines or other GABApentinoids. 

Adrafinil is an analogue of Modafinil, a schedule IV drug, so it’s obvious why that could be banned immediately. 

Here is the link to the whole bill’s information, contact your reps, we need to stop this bill.

"I just learned that 10 minutes of ""wakeful rest"" (doing nothing / no sensory input) after learning was associated with 40% higher memory retrieval a week later. What are some other cognitive-enhancing phenomena everyone should know?",1173,afwze3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/afwze3/i_just_learned_that_10_minutes_of_wakeful_rest/,100,1547509296.0,"This is something that's important in a world with constant distraction: [Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest: Intentional Rehearsal Is Not Necessary, Consolidation Is Sufficient
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109542). They gave two groups of people a free recall memory task. One group was then placed in a quiet room with no distractions for 10 minutes afterward, and the other group was given an additional cognitive task for 10 minutes afterward.

>Participants in the high sensory stimulation group completed 10 minutes of a spot-the-difference task, during which they were presented sequentially with 30 picture pairs on a laptop screen [2]. Their task was to identify and point to two differences between each picture pair within a 20-second time limit. Participants were instructed not to talk during the task, and care was taken to ensure that the spot-the-difference task was entirely visual: full instructions as well as a 1-minute practice trial were administered prior to Session 1 in order to minimalize verbalization during the delay. The spot-the-difference task was employed for two key reasons: firstly, it introduced new meaningful material and was cognitively demanding, thereby hampering word list consolidation [1]–[4], [6]. Secondly, it was non-verbal and highly unlike the word lists, thereby minimising potential interference at retrieval between word list memories and filler task memories [1], [2]. That is, the visual spot-the-difference task allowed us to examine the effect of sensory stimulation condition on word list consolidation specifically, without the potential confound of retrieval interference.

>Participants in the minimal sensory stimulation group were instructed to rest quietly in a darkened testing room while the experimenter went to ‘organize the next part of the study’ [2], [3]. To ensure minimal sensory stimulation, all equipment was turned off, and participants had no access to mobile phones, newspapers, etc.

What's interesting is that the additional cognitive task really wasn't that demanding, just pointing out two differences between laptops 30 times. That's not *so* dissimilar to making a comment on Reddit for 10 minutes, organizing your room for 10 minutes, etc. What this points to is the idea that you need rest not only *before* doing a cognitively-demanding task, but *immediately* afterward -- a 40% increase in material retrieval is absolutely insane. Even if commenting on Reddit is only 25% as cognitively demanding as pointing to differences in laptops, that's still a whopping 10% difference which is a full letter grade. 

I suppose to put this into practice you would need to take a 5 to 15 minute wakeful resting period after each chunk or subject that you are learning. So instead of stringing together programming / learning a language, you would pause for 10 minutes after each activity. You should also probably not text or move onto another task, unless the task is something that is similarly restful like walking.

What are some other psychological studies that people should know here?",2019-01-15 00:41:36

"Incredibly simple ADHD ""stack"". If you have ""cyclical"" ADHD symptoms, this could be the reason why.",817,a6it4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/,271,1544936383.0,"**EDIT 2: Posted a** [followup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/aojy6q/a_followup_to_incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you/)

**EDIT: Hey guys, glad you all like the post, but I want to make sure you're aware of some things.These symptoms also resemble bipolar disorder. They also resemble issues with your thyroid.Arguably, thyroid issues should be checked first. And if this stuff doesn't work (some stuff might need a bit of experimentation), there's a chance you have bipolar disorder.**

Hey guys, long time lurker here. My mind is blown, and I want to share my research/self-experimentation results.

**tldr;** Folic acid, B6, B12(methylcobalamin), **but NOT in a b complex** changed everything. Magnesium, when paired with these 3, make a large difference as well. The reason why is related to metabolic pathways in processing amino acids, namely Tyrosine and Phenylalanine.

I've had what I call ""cyclical"" ADHD for a long time now. Some months, feeling really good and able to manage my symptoms effortlessly, other months completely losing control of my brain. I've been on the lookout for the explanation for my ""cyclical"" symptoms for a while now. I felt like my diet influenced how I felt, but didn't understand why. I'm pretty sure I found it. A paper called ""Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems"" seems to have confirmed my hypothesis.

# Here were my symptoms:

1. **Severe Exhaustion**: Even when focusing on getting a lot of sleep, can’t feel “awake”.
2. **Anhedonia**: Even things that normally make me really happy or excited really have no impact on me. Life feels flat.
3. **Brain Fog/Dissociation**: Difficulty focusing. At it’s worst, life begins to feel like a dream, tunnel vision of the mind (unaware of my surroundings).
4. **Stimulants have very little/no impact, or negative**: Was prescribed Concerta to help with my ADHD symptoms, and took it again after a long break. Negative symptoms. Did not help with arousal or wakefulness, but induced anxiety and strong negative energy. Caffeine does nothing, or very little.
5. **Tremor**: Tremor associated with how I feel. Will have a strong tremor when feeling terrible.
6. **Complete lack of motivation**: Nothing feels worth it, even things that are urgent or fun. Even feeding myself is a massive struggle.
7. **Cold**: Body temperature issues seem to happen when in this state.
8. **Sleep**: Despite being exhausted all the time, falling asleep isn’t as easy as it is during a “good” cycle. Sleep feels less replenishing.
9. **ADHD**: ADHD symptoms are only really present during these cycles. Focus, attention, stability, emotional control are all non-issues during “good” cycles.
10. **Vision problems**: (sometimes, when really bad) Blurry vision, have experienced weird shapes appearing in my view.

# Explanation:

The metabolic pathways of the brain neurotransmitters are **very** complicated, and some people are just not as good at producing some required enzymes as others, but in a nutshell:

I had hypothesized that my issues were related to producing **tetrahydrobiopterin** (BH4), which is required in processing phenylalanine (which is required in the production of dopamine and serotonin). This is directly affected by the amount of methylfolate available in the body. BH4 is unstable, and methylfolate ""protects"" it. There is a syndrome called Phenylketonuria (PKU) which mirrored my symptoms pretty well, right down to the tremor. I might have a ""mild"" form of this, since I've bypassed my symptoms in the past with diet. Having issues with BH4 production will raise the levels of phenylalanine in the blood, causing other cognitive issues.

Another theory I had, was that I had an issue with **Tyrosine Hydroxylase** (TH). Interestingly, BH4 is a cofactor to TH. An issue with BH4 will lead to an issue with with Tyrosine Hydroxylase. An issue with this enzyme would explain why Methylphenidate was unable to raise the amount of dopamine in my brain (after having not taken it for weeks). TH requires vitamin B6 to produce dopamine (oversimplification). It would also explain why NALT had such a strong impact on me but lost its effectiveness. A surplus of tyrosine in the brain won't do anything if there is a TH deficiency.

B12 is also a cofactor of serotonin and dopamine, however, I don't know in what part of the chain. When it comes to metabolic pathways, methylcobalamin is superior, both in bioavailability and when it comes to methyl groups. Methylcobalamin is the active form, and doesn't require any methyl groups, allowing for more production of methylfolate. A paper I read also stated that a lack of B6 and folate will also cause a b12 deficiency. If I find it again, I'll link it here.

**So why not in b complex**? There are huge interactions between the b vitamins, and some vitamins can undo another vitamins effect. For example, Niacin absorbs methyl groups, reducing your bodies ability to create methylfolate. This can reduce the amount of BH4 available in the body, negatively impacting Tyrosine Hydroxylase! Less TH, less dopamine. Furthermore, it's hypothesized that people with ADHD contain too much Serotonin. I've read a few studies that found that an excess of serotonin can decrease dopamine transmission. From my reading, niacin (somehow) promotes Serotonin. Niacin makes me feel horrible (long after the flush)

There are many, many other details. For further reading, I recommend reading :

[(Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407547). Note that to read the whole paper, you'll probably need access to some university database.

The paper goes into much further detail, involving genetics, epigenetics, homocysteine's role in the pathophysiology of ADHD symptoms caused by metabolic issues.

Note: My background is not in biochemistry, but instead in engineering. Some stuff is also simplified into a ""nutshell"" form. There are many, many more details to this. I do not fully understand the intimate details, but loosely understand their relationship.

# Blood Tests

* A high blood level of phenylalanine indicates issues with BH4 production. Note that this likely indicates PKU, but might be mild and just aggravated by low methylfolate concentrations.
* B6 blood tests exist, but I'm not sure exactly how those work.

I wish I would have done these tests prior to taking these supplements, but since this regime works for me, why fix what's not broken?

# Stack Modifications/Additions

* **(B6)** Pyridoxal phosphate instead of Pyridoxine HCL could help some people with metabolism issues in creating the active form of vitamin B6. Be careful with excess B6, however, as it can cause neuropathy and liver damage.
* **(Folic Acid)** Methylfolate can be bought instead of folic acid, but folic acid is cheaper and effective for most people. There are some people that might benefit from this. Keep in mind that Methylfolate can have strong side effects.
* **Magnesium**: This one is well known, but lesser known is that the study commonly cited for magnesium's effectiveness with ADHD also paired magnesium with vitamin B6. The two appear to have synergistic effects?
* **BH4:** BH4 is available as a prescription medicine in the US/Canada under the brand name Kuvan. If you have a high level of phenylalanine in your blood, you likely could get a prescription for Kuvan.
* **Zinc:** This one is commonly known. Zinc is commonly low in ADHD patients. It helps me. Don't take too much.
* **SAMe:** This helps with methylation, which indirectly helps with BH4? This could help.

This is likely to only help a subgroup of ADHD patients, but it's worth looking into metabolic issues. This has really helped me.

edit: oh boy, lots to respond to. Didn't expect this to gather this much attention

Some other useful details:

Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,725,82q1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,187,1520472602.0,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed.",2018-03-08 02:30:02

**Conclusion: Jarrow is entirely safe for consumption, as is pure nootropics.** I apologize for casting any doubt on their safety or quality.

edit: Hey everyone FYI, my post title was misleading - upon closer inspection the study focuses on ayurvedic medicines in general and not specifically ashwagandha. On top of that, it didn't study brands that are popular currently (the study is almost a decade old) and so is not by any means an accurate reflection of what you're likely to encounter while shopping online. So it's doubtful that 20% of the Ashwagandha available currently is contaminated with unsafe levels of toxic metals.

That being said, given that there is no regulatory oversight with these products, some amount of wariness and caution is always warranted to some degree.

/End Edit

Almost every post on here involves a few things that I find disturbing: 

1. Recommending something based off of short-term experience. I.e. “just took ashwaganda and it CURED my anxiety!” Chances are it didn’t cure your anxiety, it’s just a temporary patch for the symptoms. Many substances that have positive short-term effects end up being a negative in the long run. In fact, it’s usually the ones that feel the best at first that are the hardest to quit because of the permanent damage you’re doing to your neurotransmitters, and it’s often hard for us to even admit that they’re not good for us. 

2. Casually recommending dosages that are FAR too high for the average person. Everybody’s different, and not everyone should be trying a dosage that happens to work for you, especially because, let’s be frank, many of us are current/former drug users and require more stimulation to affect our mind and behavior. 

3. Underestimating side effects. This is kind of a corollary of the first two, but too often on here i see people saying stuff like “you could try theanine, it’s just an amino acid so there’s no risk”. Or “you don’t build a tolerance”. Regarding ANY psychoactive substance, which includes pretty much every nootropic mentioned on this sub (if you feel different, it’s psychoactive) including substances that we often tout as harmless like theanine or caffeine, you WILL build a tolerance, and this could lead to dependency. 

4. Recommending nootropics for sleep. Nootropics that help us fall asleep don’t necessarily give us BETTER sleep. Even if you feel more refreshed in the morning you may not necessarily be getting healthy sleep. Substances that affect your sleep hormones can change your sleep cycles, causing you to miss the right combination of light, deep, REM and other stages of sleep that all have their own specific purpose for repairing different parts of the body and mind. 
 
And taking these substances habitually to fall asleep will cause you to develop a dependency, meaning you’ll have an even tougher time falling asleep without that substance than you did before you ever took it. If you aren’t getting good sleep there are many other things you can try such as meditation, reducing light exposure at night, keeping a consistent bedtime routine, using your bed for the purpose of sleep ONLY, getting sunlight exposure and/or exercising early in the day, taking a hot shower an hour before bed so your body cools as you get ready for bed (which sends signals to your brain to start producing sleep hormones). 

5. Many of these substances are not well studied and we can’t assume they aren’t doing some sort of long-term damage. There are many things that have been a part of our everyday lives for years before we discovered the extent of their adverse health effects (tobacco, asbestos, sugar, plastics).

6. Assuming that a single benefit, even when proven through scientific study, means that a nootropic is worth taking. Just because a substance has a single benefit doesn’t mean that that benefit outweighs all the risks and damages. Green tea extract, for example, contains healthy anti-oxidants, but it’s also hard on the liver, and proper steps need to be taken to insure that damage to the liver is mitigated and determine whether it’s even worth taking at all. 

Additionally, many vitamins/supplements, while they may be useful to supplement if we are deficient in something essential, can be harmful when taken in excess or when they’re not needed. Many substances, such as magnesium and zinc, compete for absorption within the body, so that even though you may feel that you are helping yourself by supplementing magnesium to help aid digestion, for example, you may be causing a deficiency in zinc, which can cause diarrhea, hair loss, impotence, and all sorts of other health issues. It’s important to GET BLOODWORK done before supplementing and during, to know exactly how you’re affecting your body. Most people can just ask their primary care physician to get bloodwork done for a small fee.

I’m not saying that we should all stay away from nootropics. Some of them can be effective when taken responsibly, by:

1. easing into use with small dosages

2. cycling use

3. taking only one at a time to observe its effects on the body independent of other substances

4. weening one’s self off other more serious substances/drugs

5. After putting serious effort into trying more natural and safer methods that have proven to be more effective over time (meditation, exercise, healthy eating, 8 hours of sleep, hydrating), it’s often said, but is worth reiterating, that if exercise were sold in a pill people would pay top dollar for it. 

Lastly, many psychological issues, such as problems concentrating, anxiety, depression are the result of our lives’s circumstances and our inability to accept them and work to make them better. It may seem impossible at some points in our lives, but we could all benefit from finding people and things that we love and making those our priority. Love and a sense of purpose are more powerful forces than any nootropic out there.",2019-09-22 12:36:43

>The glymphatic pathway [in the brain] expedites clearance of waste, including soluble amyloid(A) to prevent amyloid plaques from accumulating in the brain. Researchers have shown that patients suffering from chronic impairment of glymphatic pathway function due to traumatic brain injury are vulnerable to tau aggregation and the onset of neurodegeneration. These patients have an increased chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease (Iliff et al., 2014).

>**Put simply, the glymphatic system eliminates brain waste to prevent diseases of the central nervous system such as dementia.**

>Sleep Posture and the Glymphatic System

>Transport through this pathway is controlled by the brain’s arousal level, making sleep hygiene important to the glymphatic system. During sleep the brain’s interstitial space volume expands compared to its size during wakefulness or arousal. Increased interstitial space with sleep results in faster waste removal.

>Humans exhibit different body postures during sleep, which may also affect waste removal. Therefore, not only the level of consciousness, but also body posture, might affect CSF–interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange efficiency throughout the night.

>**Researchers confirmed that glymphatic transport and clearance was superior in the lateral and supine sleeping positions.** The researchers proposed that sleeping on your side has evolved to optimize waste removal during sleep and that posture is considered ideal for glymphatic transport.

>The lateral sleeping position is also advantageous for your posture. To optimize ‘Brain Drain’ and to prevent musculoskeletal pain, consider the importance of your sleeping posture. Sleeping on your side with a small pillow between your legs is considered the ideal sleeping position.",2018-07-19 06:56:59

Why Your Nootropics Arent Working,540,dir6b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dir6b1/why_your_nootropics_arent_working/,187,1571269766.0,"I dove into noots about 10 years ago, around the time Dave Asprey was coming out of hiding and Modafanil was starting to get popular traction. I got involved because like everyone else here, I wanted to perform better in all areas of my life, especially my work, which is very technically obtuse and demanding. I took these compounds very seriously, and they have vastly improved my life.

Along the way I realized a few critical elements that caused ""non response"" to certain doses and compounds. Ive also read far too many accounts here on reddit and other  biohacking forums of people saying things like ""its a placebo"" or, ""This stuff doesn't work"".  If you're experiencing shitty results, id like to offer a few of my observations as to why:

1. ***Your Baseline sucks. -*** If you havent changed the oil in your car in over a year, neglected all your filters, drive on bald tires and generally avoid any maintenance, will a brand new performance exhaust and the most expensive racing fuel make your driving experience any better? If you want performance enhancement drugs to have an impact on your performance, you better make sure the basics are in order - Sleep, Reasonable Nutrition, Hydration and a host of other fundamental elements need to be tight if you want to step up your game with Nootropics. Your brain/body cant use energy systems you've been trashing with Mcdonalds and Vodka for a week.
2. ***You think Noots are NZT-like super drugs -*** This is the most common explanation for why people say ""X compound doesn't work"". No drug on the planet is going to motivate you to put the PlayStation controller down and do what you're supposed to be doing to elevate your life Game. YOU have to cultivate your own motivation to do what your laziness is currently keeping you from doing, and smart drugs will assist you once you get there. If your looking for a drug to ""make you do it"", Nootropics will always leave you disappointed. Take some initiative bro. There is no magic bullet, just bigger and better guns. 'still have to learn to shoot.
3. ***Youre not self-experimenting properly -*** There are about 30 compounds I can think of that will have a profound effect on your performance. Which of those is right for you and what doses can only be answered by one person: YOU. Theres no way a 275lb Bodybuilder with an I.Q. of 30 who sleeps 10 Hrs is going to have the same experience as a 19 y/o weakling studying for the BAR exam who sleeps 4H,  but for some reason, the biohacking community tends to lump these two together in terms of chemical reactions.Do legitimate self-experimental cycles, *one compound at a time,* for an extended period of time before you jump to a conclusion.
4. ***You're not dosing surgically -*** some compounds are only effective at a certain dose range, and that dose is going to be particular to YOUR body. Stop downing fistfuls of shit because you're ""Experienced with drugs, and have a high tolerance to pills"". Do your research. Separate the Signal from the Noise and understand what these compounds actually do inside you, what they deplete and what the consequences of use are. More is almost never better. Start low, and gradually increase if your self experimentation calls for it.
5. **You dont need chemical enhancement, you need to clean your room. -** When i was a competitive power lifter, I took a shit ton of steroids. Some people may argue with the morality of this, but they are clueless to the fact that its what you have to do if you want to win medals at a professional level in this sport, and compete with straight up bio-mutant humans on the platform.Because of my size and performance, Gym Rats and New-bros would ask me all the time, What should I take and what dose? My response was always this: Chemical Performance enhancement is level 10 shit. If your on level 0, meaning you skip the gym, skip meals, get dehydrated daily, drink out every night and sleep for 5 hours you have no biz taking performance enhancement drugs. You're just lazy and looking for a magic bullet. Earn your right to take things to the next level, stop trying to cheat yourself. Come back when you're level 9.

**TLDR: Your Baseline is fucked. You dont sleep enough, eat shitty foods, treat your body & spirit like trash, and expect a pill to turn you into Elon Musk overnight. Drink more water, consume less carbs and social media, get 30 min of light exercise daily, make your bed everyday and I bet a dollar to a doughnut your Noots will ""work"" better.**",2019-10-17 01:49:26

Fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive decline in aging women.

Kang JH1, Ascherio A, Grodstein F.

Abstract

We prospectively examined fruit and vegetable intake in relation to cognitive function and decline among aging women. Participants were followed from in 1976 with biennial questionnaires, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. From 1995 to 2001, we administered, by telephone, six cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. We repeated assessments two years later for 13,388 women (>90% follow-up). We averaged dietary intakes from 1984 through the first cognitive assessment, and used linear regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted mean differences in performance and decline in performance across intake levels. **Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline**. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of **cruciferous vegetables** declined slower (by 0.04 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.003, 0.07; p trend = 0.1) compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most **green leafy** vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount (by 0.05 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.02, 0.09; p trend < 0.001). These mean differences were equivalent to those observed for women about 1 to 2 years apart in age.

Cerebral Health Pyritinol Test Results (WARNING),492,1mmip9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/,229,1379510752.0,"Many of you may remember the issue that came up with Cerebral Health/Bioscience Nutraceuticals a few months ago, where their choline bitartrate was numbing people's mouths. After sending those samples in to the lab, the tests came back negative for choline bitartrate. We suspected it was choline salacylate, but decided further testing to ascertain the exact compound would not be worth the cost. Unfortunately that was not the last issue to come from Cerebral Health.

A few weeks ago, another Redditor placed an order pyritinol from CH, along with some alpha GPC and oxiracetam. When the order arrived, both the alpha GPC and oxiracetam seemed alright. However, the pyritinol seemed off. Before thinking about it, he took his normal 400mg dose of pyritinol and went out for a mountain bike ride. Within 15-20 minutes he was getting a weird euphoria and detachment. After another couple minutes, his memory gets very fuzzy. 

Eventually his sister found him in the garage in a manic/psychotic state. He was biting his lips very hard, shaking, and holding his fists tight. Eventually he went into seizures when the paramedics came. He was taken to the hospital and seized again while waiting for the doctor. He had a crazed look in his eyes like what you see with people having a psychotic episode on MDPV. He was in the hospital for 4 days.

Not putting two and two together yet, he tried another small dose of pyritinol a few days after getting home, to see what effects came back. Sure enough, he started to get the euphoria and disassociation that he felt before. He also got the same crazed look in his eyes, and same rolling nystagmus. It tasted nothing like pyritinol, but more like burnt plastic. His cognition was off for a while due to the seizures, but he was sure it was the Cerebral Health pyritinol that caused it.

After doing some searching for similar reactions and physical properties online, he came to the conclusion that the compound was most likely a cathinone derivative like MDPV. All the effects fit with an overdose on something like MDPV. Since 400mg is a normal dose for pyritinol, but a massive dose for MDPV, that is most likely what caused the blackout and seizures. Since then he has been having intermittent seizures, and has been back in the hospital 3 times.

After speaking with the other moderators, we decided we needed to send a sample into the lab to get this tested. To prevent any accusations of tampering with the sample, I had another moderator order a whole new bag from them, then send a sample from that into the lab to be tested. So we now have two samples of the compound in question. The original one that sent the Redditor to the hospital, and the separate order we placed right after we became aware of the issue. Today the results came back, and it tested negative for pyritinol. I spoke to Colin at the lab, and he said that the FTIR did not match up at all, and that it was a completely unrelated compound. Due to legal constraints, the lab did not want to do a full workup on the compound apart from confirming it was not pyritinol. So we are going to be sending another sample from the same batch to Dacesafe.org to do a full workup. It will tell us exactly what the compound is, and what purity level it is at.

[Here is the result from Colmeric](http://i.imgur.com/cCOCMUs.jpg)

So in light of this, I suggest that nobody purchases anything from Cerebral Health. This is the second instance in the last 6 months where they have been selling a completely different substance than what it was advertised as. In this particular instance, it could even be a dangerous and illegal substance. Until we do a full workup, I cannot say for sure if this substance was MDPV or another cathinone derivative. However, it is definitely a psychoactive compound other than pyritinol. Obviously a lawyer is going to be brought in by the Redditor that went to the hospital, so I may have to take certain statements down eventually. However, I want everyone to be aware of this serious issue before it potentially puts another person in the hospital!

**EDIT: After further testing, the substance was identified as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).**

In his latest podcast (with Sinclair which was super interesting) he says he takes 3 different nootropic supps all of which have multiple ingredients. 

One of them is trubrain which is-

>L-theanine, Caffeine, Uridine, Centrophenoxine, Magnesium, Tyrosine, N-Acetyl Carnitine, Citicholine, Monk Fruit, Mangosteen, Nopal Concentrate, Noopept, Cane Sugar, Blue Agave, Purified Water, Xylitol, Nisin, Polylysine.

Okay so now what if you have a negative reaction to that? how on earth would you determine which specific ingredient you reacted to? same with a positive reaction. Its possible only one of those ingredients is helping you and the rest are just doing nothing or actually doing damage to your brain chemistry. You dont know!  

Also there are multiple cholinergic substances in that. Too much of that can fuck you up. 

Now consider he ALSO is taking 2 other nootropic supplement which ALSO have multiple ingredients! This is like 30 - 40 nootropic ingredients this man is sucking down for shits and giggles.

He seems to be following the ""Just take ALL the nootropics ALL the time! More and more! Balls to the Wall! Fuck yeah!"" approach

sorry but that if FUCKING STUPID! You are messing with your brain chemistry and turning your body into a ongoing chemistry experiment. Bad. Wrong. No. Dont do it, dont follow his lead. 

Do ONE nootropic at a time, see how you react and then adjust accordingly.

The biggest mistake beginners make with nootropics,455,cv16e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cv16e5/the_biggest_mistake_beginners_make_with_nootropics/,55,1566720345.0,"I've been testing all kinds of nootropics, supplements and even prescription strength medications for over 15 years, and I've seen a really big issue.  


How many times have you or read about someone taking a supplement and, suddenly, they are cured.  
They have an amazing day. They feel great. Pain is gone, or energy is up. Mood is transformed.   
Everything clicks.  


So much of the testimony on this subreddit is actually these types of account. First day. First week. First 2 weeks.   


But, then what happens?  
The effects are gone. The person returns to baseline. And the whole thing might be forgotten. No long term progress is achieved. 

There are 2 causes for this.   
(1) The placebo effect. (2) A ""Triggering"" effect   


The placebo effect has been well documented and studied so I won't go into it.  
The ""Triggering"" effect is the one I want to highlight because this is where the problem happens.  


Human beings naturally go through mood cycles. Happy days. Sad days. Angry days.   
These moods can even last for few days or even a week or two.   


In the most intense example we have hypo-manic disorder. Where you have extreme episodes alternating between ecstatic/high energy/euphoria/happiness/motivation followed by episodes of depression/irritability/hopelessness.   


That's the most extreme example and it's not something seriously effecting most people. But, the key is understanding these mood cycles.   


As a person goes through their life, they will naturally go through  these sad/happy/angry/etc mood cycles -- btw there is no specific rhythm to this other than a high energy/low energy rhythm mediated by the para-sympathetic/sympathetic nervous system. And all this will happen WITHOUT any supplementation.   


So, when you take a supplement and you happen to be ""ready"" for a positive mood, then that action helps trigger that mood. It's similar to how if a person gets a complement or a kind gesture, and they feel incredible.   


So it's critical to distinguish the intrinsic effects of the supplement versus the natural cycles that are happening.   


Having said that, what's the solution?   
The most important thing is to STOP looking for a ""silver bullet"" or magical cure.   
Most nootropics & supplements offer little immediate cognitive benefits. And those that do, will give you a boost. But they won't ""cure"" you.   


The key is to understand that ""you"" are the cure.   
The quality of your life comes from the quality of your living.   
It's how you sleep, eat, move.   
It's how you take care of yourself mentally and emotionally.  
It's the quality of relationships and deeper meaning to life.   


That's what personally helped me the most, is when I stopped trying to find ""a cure"" and realize that all of life is an on-going process, and I can achieve my goals if I continue to make improvements.   


In that sense, ""fatigue"" or ""low energy"" isn't a ""on/off"" switch.   
It's not binary.   
You aren't tired OR energetic.   
It's a gradient. A scale.

And then it's about asking the question:   
""How do I add more positive inputs to achieve my outcome?""   
And all kinds of nootropics and supplements are part of the process.   


But, ultimately it's so important to stop living life in terms of ""singular events"" i.e. I took a supplement and now my depression is gone. And then if the supplement stops working a few days later, then ""the cure"" has failed and you are back to square 1. It's all an on-going process. You are the scientist of your body and your life, and you continuously conduct experiments to see what works and what does. And then you do more of what works, and less of what doesn't.  


I'm sharing this because this is the biggest piece of advice I'd give myself 15 years ago, because I ended up wasting years and years trying all kinds of ""one time cures"" and not making progress. It wasn't until I embraced the ""process based""/holistic mindset, that I started to achieve my health/mind goals with the help of nootropics.",2019-08-25 10:05:45

A 10+ year nootropic enthusiast’s list of 20 obscure nootropics/supplements you may or may know about,455,bclp1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bclp1g/a_10_year_nootropic_enthusiasts_list_of_20/,192,1555149469.0,"Just thought I’d share my experiences with some not-so-well-known nootropics/supplements I’ve taken. Most of them are Russian, which is probably why there aren’t much user experiences written about them on here or Longecity. Let me know if you want me to go into more detail on any of them or if you have any questions. If some of you find this list helpful I can make more lists of nootropics I’ve tried for different symptoms (mood, cognition, social anxiety, anhedonia). Check out my early post history for more reviews or my old account which I lost the password to and can not access anymore (/u/Nedzilla55). Anyways, here’s my list of 20 not-so-well-know (and a few we’ll know) nootropics/supplements. They’re listed in no particular order.



1) Pantogam and Pantogam Activ - Feels somewhat like Phenibut lite, without the extreme tolerance. Effects are not as intense as phenibut or Baclofen but it’s a nice little anxiolytic which is somewhat energizing as well (as strange as that sounds). Almost like a couple of drinks. Made it easier for me to just be myself (as weird as that sounds). You may find yourself humming in the car or listening to music while doing goofy dance moves from the early 2000s. Makes it easier to laugh and just enjoy myself while being in the moment.


2) Low Dose Amisilpride (12.5mg - 25mg). Don’t let the antipsychotic label scare you: that’s only at regular doses. At very low doses, it enhances dopamine transmission and facilitates dopamineric neurotransission and is a wonderful “as needed” mood brightener. Great for anhedonia. Helps to feel more “in the moment” and makes things like conversations with others more enjoyable.


3) Tenoten - Didn’t feel much from this one unfortunately. It’s supposed to work for anxiety and stress. Not too many experience reports online either (In English, at least). Might as well have been a sugar pill.


4) GABOB - Brain fog, sleepy ness, sedation... not a fan of this one. Benadryl type feeling almost. Not enjoyable at all and overall letdown IME.


5) Picamilon - Developed by Soviet Russia, this is considered a pro drug of GABA. It can be somewhat energizing or anxiolytic depending on the dose. Very subtle though, possible placebo effect. I haven’t found too many positive experiences online with this one either.


6) Agomelatine - This atypical antidepressant is an agonist at the melatonin receptors along with 5-HT2C antagonist. Helps me fall asleep when taken before bedtime, but has an activating/energizing feel upon waking up. Good alternative to try if you’ve had no luck with conventional antidepressants. I've read experience reports about it causing irritation at higher doses. I have not experienced this but YMMV.


7) Afobazole - This obscure little Ruski supplement feels somewhat anxiolytic but effects were pretty subtle to me. I may revisit this one with a higher dosage 


8) Sarcosine+NAC - Ok so this one may not be very obscure but I enjoy its effects so I figured I’d at least share. NAC literally cured my trichtillomania. It’s an amazing antioxidant. Taken an hour before drinking it prevents hangovers IME. Sarcosine is great for anhedonia and other “negative symptoms”. Makes it easier to engage with others and “feel”.


9) Grandaxin - This is an interesting one. Its commonly described as “anxiolytic” and “tranquilizing” though I would not really agree with that description. It’s an It feels activating physically yet quiets the mind. Too big of a dose caused irritability


10) Stresam - Nice little anxiolytic. Helps calm the mind and body. I like it to unwind after a stressful day at work. Puts me in a nice chill state when kicking back and watching documentaries or hanging out in nature


11) BPC-157 - Apparently it’s good for reducing stimulant tolerance and injuries? Again another one that may not be very obscure but I thought it may be of interest to some of you. 


12) Nefiracetam - I love this one. Nice little mood brightener. It’s hard to explain but it helps me connect the dots at work and when doing everyday activities. It makes it easy for me to read between the lines, especially in work/social situations. It’s almost like it makes me feel more aware. Like I was brushing my teeth one day on it and I just zoned out to the feeling of the bristles of my toothbrush going against my teeth and gums and just kind of had me in the moment. It made me think “why do I wet my toothbrush, maybe it’s better to leave it dry because the toothpaste sticks better to the toothbrush and my teeth”. This may or may not be wrong but I’ve had similar epiphanies on it. That may sound dumb but I don’t know how to better describe its effect on me. I wish someone would have this in stock again :(


13) Oxytocin - I took it before an interview and had the best interview in my life. I was so engaged with the interviewer and felt like we already had some sort of connection. It was very easy to express myself. My girlfriend said I was very romantic (lol) when I took it before going out to dinner with her (which is sort of unusual for me). Great for deep convos and connecting with others. This is one of those that I can clearly rule out a placebo effect.


14) Sulbutiamine - I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately did not feel much of anything despite trying many different doses. People on here and Longecity reported energizing effects. Maybe I’m just a non-responder?


15) Galantamine - this one is a cholinesterase inhibitor . Perefct for those who enjoy lucid dreaming. Increases acetylcholine in the brain, which may or may not be a good thing based on your personal neurochemistry. 


16) Semax - These next 2 are not very obscure to those familiar with nootropics but felt I should include them for some reason. This one is activating. I really like it for jogging, hiking, and other outdoor activities.


17) Selank - Semax’s chill twin brother. This one is more anxiolytic. I really enjoy walks in the woods with this one for some reason. Or just sitting on my back porch enjoying the nice weather and scenery.


18) P-21 - R.I.P. Ceretropic :( not sure if this is available anymore but I enjoyed its effects. It had more of an activating feel in my experience. Somewhat anxiogenic at times even. Not in a bad way though. Effects are hard to describe with this one.


19) D-Cycloserine - This one “aids in learning by helping form stronger neural connections”. Good for exposure therapy. I have a feeling this one would work much better when combined with CBT


20) GTS-21 - this one is a partial agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is a horrible smelly yellow substance with a repulsive taste and it leaves yellow stains on anything it touches, including your hands. Felt somewhat anxiolytic though activating at the same time. I’ve only taken it for a week though. I may need to take it for a longer period of time to really feel its effects though. I will trial it for a month and report back it’s effects.",2019-04-13 11:57:49

"After two years of development, we've made the first caffeien + L-theanine nootropic gum!",419,3kgtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3kgtz4/after_two_years_of_development_weve_made_the/,228,1441953049.0,"Hey r/nootropics!

Nearly two years ago, my brother (best friend) and I began working on NeuroGum, the first sugar-free caffeine + L-theanine nootropic gum. We saw all these other companies charging exorbitant amounts of money simply encapsulating caffeine and L-theanine, and we began brainstorming ways of creating an alternative that was delicious, affordable, and also portable. Beyond that, we wanted a way of making nootropics more accessible to the average consumer.

&nbsp;

So we borrowed some money and began experimenting by putting caffeine and L-theanine into a gum base. Of course, that first iteration tasted terrible and it crumbled apart. After a few unsuccessful attempts, we finally began working with a certified gum chemist, and over a dozen iterations later, we finally found a way of cold compressing:

* 40mg of caffeine
* 60mg of L-theanine
* 30% Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
* 100% Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)

into a piece of gum. Instead of aspartame, we used sorbitol, stevia, and a natural mint + vanilla flavor mix to mask the flavors and created our very own nootropic gum!

&nbsp;
        
I wanted to share to this subreddit because the amazing content here changed my life. We've been working super hard for the last two years and just launched on Indiegogo today. With the money we raise, we can finish our first production run and get our gum out to as many people as possible.

&nbsp;

You can pre-order here on our Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/neurogum

and you can also check out our website at www.neurogum.com!

Once we launch, I promise I'll be back with some coupon codes for everyone here! If there's any questions, feel free to ask! This is my personal account so I'll be lurking in and out between shifts all day.

Cheers guys!

&nbsp;


**EDIT: Wow. I'm absolutely thrilled. Yesterday, our Indiegogo campaign reached our goal, and now we can pay to finish our first production run. It's been such an overwhelming experience receiving feedback, support, and wonderful discussion for all of you here. After we talk with our manufacturer first thing tomorrow morning, we are going to begin working on some stretch goals like different flavors and our L-theanine gum.**

**This subreddit has been so amazing, and I can't be more grateful. Thank you all so much!**
 
**SO, for everyone who has already ordered, we sped up the timeline! We are going to work hard to get the gum shipped out as quickly as possible! We'll finalize the order tomorrow, receive it in two weeks, then set up something to get it out to you. I can't wait for you all to try NeuroGum!**

&nbsp;

**EDIT (PART 2): After feedback, we dropped our price so NeuroGum is less than $3 a pack! Code Redditropics also gives an extra 10% off so you'll get it for even less :)

[A human study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425476) found that 3 months of daily Magnesium supplementation are needed to significantly increase RBC (Red Blood Cell) Magnesium levels. The study used Magnesium Di-Malate (supplement form is usually Magnesium Mono-Malate, should be similar), and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as it is known B6 improves Magnesium absorption.

After 30 days, the participants had a 6% higher RBC Mg content. After 90 days, however, the participants had a 30% higher RBC Mg content, which is considered a significant increase. The 6% increase at 30 days could be beneficial as well, but it shows that restoring normal Magnesium stores in the body can take a long time.

Magnesium Malate is known to be well absorbed, but even with its good absorption, it can take as long as 3 months to fix a deficiency. 

****

It seems like many people here decide that a certain Magnesium supplement is useless, after only a few weeks on it, and then switch to another one that they claim to find more effective. What might actually be happening, is that the multiple weeks of being on the first Magnesium supplement partially fixed the deficiency, making the second Magnesium supplement build on top of that, hence having more noticeable effects.",2018-09-13 06:06:19

I recently purchased 100g of what i believed to be Piracetam from Cerebral Health. After 3 days of dosing 2g in the morning i now feel what can only be described as brain damaged. I can no longer form coherent sentences, my memory is, well, ruined! I also find it hard to concentrate on anything which i found alarming so i contacted ""Professor Douglas. J. Phillips"", the owner of CH who i found to be not helpful whatsoever. I mean this guy flat out denied any problems with his products which is a complete lie! He asked about my diet which is fine, i also abstain from drinking alcohol albeit i was a heavy drinker in the past, and had a brief history of Cocaine use but that was years ago. I admitted this to help with Phillip's personal assessment but he stopped playing doctor by then and didn't reply.

After doing a google search on this SOB i found some alarming results:

**""David Ira Minkoff, M.D., who testified on Phillips's behalf, also had serious trouble. On August 3, 2001, the Florida Board of Medicine fined him $10,000 and suspended his license for one year, to be followed by two years of probation [3]. Minkoff, a Scientologist, was implicated in the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who allegedly died of malnutrition while in the custody of other Scientologists. Documents in the case indicate that even though Minkoff had never met McPherson, he prescribed sedative medication by telephone to Church of Scientology staff members who had called on her behalf. Although admitting no guilt, Minkoff reached a $100,000 settlement in 1997 in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McPherson's estate.""**

**In June 2010, Department of Health investigators came to Phillips' office as undercover patients.

I'm going for a blood test Monday and have been told to bring along the ""Piracetam"" so it can be tested. I have contacted the FDA who are very interested and also want me to send a sample. If there's any long term damage caused i'm not going to give up till this guy is finished!


Mr. Phillips also posts on http://brainmeta.com/forum/ under the pseudonym of ""GodConsciousness"", discrediting any bad experiences as companies merely trying to stain his already bad reputation. LOL! Not to mention his company sponsors the brainmeta forum (facepalm).

Yes, this is my fault and i agree i should have done more research before purchasing but if i can prevent this from happening to someone else i'll be happy.

"[A comprehensive guide] LSD and MDMA for permanent cognitive enhancement. The best ""nootropic"" is the ability to develop good habits.",366,5updzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5updzj/a_comprehensive_guide_lsd_and_mdma_for_permanent/,116,1487402169.0,"Cross-posted to r/drugs but I wrote this originally for you guys.

So there has been some interest in LSD after some posts about microdosing, and I have a lot of experience microdosing on and off as well as experience taking full doses of LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA for the sole purpose of self development.

If you haven't already read my previous post, I have an [LSD trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ajwd6/this_was_the_most_meaningful_experience_of_my/) as well as my MDMA trip report that I [just posted on /r/Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5utmoj/mdma_might_be_the_greatest_therapeutic_substance/).

Some things to consider. DOSAGE MATTERS. Effects do NOT follow a linear scale. In other words. 25mcg is not ""double"" the feeling of 12.5mcg. Also 50mcg is completely different than 100mcg. You could be jittery on one dose and totally focused on another.

**Objectives - LSD**

I've been obsessed with self development, so what drew me to psychedelics was a few things. 

* Psychedelics take your essence and allow you to observe it as though you were looking at yourself from the objective perspective of a completely different human being. You gain an insane hyperawareness into your thoughts and behaviors that would take months to truly understand otherwise. Even if you can logically deduce something for yourself in a sober state, psychedelics helps you ***internalize this logic in a significantly more effective way***.
* Psychedelics increases neurogenesis (see below)
* Psychedelics can help rewire synapses that feel extremely hard wired (ie. people often completely quit smoking the day after. Bad habits are significantly easier to understand and reform after the fact, etc)
* Psychedelics make you better appreciate the world around you, which in turn removes the pressure to perform and thus makes you perform better
* Psychedelics help you reform bad habits and put you on a good track towards developing new habits.

Here is an excerpt that summarizes psychedelic effects on neurogenesis:

>LSD does cause an increase in BDNF, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. LSD can be described as polyamorious in that is binds to every single seratonin and dopamine receptor. To have a greater affect on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis you really want activation of the three rectptors mentioned earlier. This is where psilocybin enters the conversation. Psilocybin has greater affinity for the three sites mentioned, and the effect of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity is also greater, because of the selectivity of psilocybin. 

So why LSD over Mushrooms even though mushrooms have an arguably greater effect on neurogenesis? The short answer is control. Shrooms are like a magical train ride into the alien depths of your brain. It could be a good time, it could be a bad time, but once you board there's no getting off. A good trip sitter can help adjust the tracks and get you through a ""bad experience"", but you can't really will yourself into a different mindset as easily.

If you really want to get a scientific understanding of LSD and its effects, please read Dr. Fadiman's book. It has tons of objective studies, quantitative data, etc that backs up the aforementioned bullet points. I'm not going to do your homework for you so take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research if what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. There are dozens of studies out there.

Now to be clear, the chance of having a bad trip on shrooms with a good trip sitter is more rare than you think, and a lot of people say that their ""bad trips"" were incredibly insightful and ultimately productive nonetheless, but some people can't handle the unknown, so it's important to know yourself. Regardless, you will come out of the other side with new insights and what you do with them is up to you.

*TL;DR:* The objective for me was to better understand my flaws and work to overcome the bottlenecks in my own personality to become a better, more intelligent, and more efficient person in my pursuit of self development.

**Objectives - MDMA**

At first I wasn't very interested in MDMA, but after doing it I realized it's absolutely incredible in ways that LSD could NEVER be.

* MDMA works on the parts of your brain that regulate fear, empathy, trust, and openness
* MDMA is in the final stages of FDA approval
* MDMA allows you to take the most traumatizing memories of your life and come to terms with them in ways that would take months or years with traditional therapy alone
* MDMA can help you understand and overcome the paralyzing fears of failure, self-doubt, and personal rigidity

**Giving my friends LSD/MDMA in therapeutic sessions**

After experiencing all this myself I truly wanted to share it with everyone I knew. I carefully reached out to friends I knew who had major to minor issues with personality, relationships, etc and took them through my protocol.

* One friend went from smoking 1 pack of cigarettes every 2 days to smoking 1 pack every 2 weeks. If she had a little more self control in general i'm certain she could give it up entirely. She was also able to realize that she was in a toxic relationship and leave her crazy bf after realizing some important things during her trip. She also expressed a new appreciation for nature after walking in the park during her trip.
* Another friend who took 250mcg of LSD told me she suddenly realized that the source of her anger had been her father all along, who had left her and her siblings when she was young. She thought that she had come to terms with this but the LSD made her realize it was still deep within her mind and causing her to be constantly angry. It's been more than a month since her trip and she has expressed that she rarely ever gets angry. She also told me that she sees ""through"" people and has extraordinary insight into manipulative behavior whereas before she would take things at face value. She's been able to register for classes after a long hiatus due to her feeling uncertain about her life. She has a lot more confidence now
* Another friend who had severe self-esteem issues due to his constantly disparaging wife realized his self worth and was able to overcome his paralyzing self-deprecation. He is now studying for a certification to go back to work on a subject he's always been passionate about but too afraid to pursue due to his own mental obstacles.
* My best friend and her husband took MDMA and resolved some of the biggest barriers in their relationship practically overnight. Both of them were able to talk so freely about what was on their mind while simultaneously accepting each other that it literally made all their arguments seem petty and moot. Their relationship is still significantly more open and stronger, 4 wees after the fact. They understand each other better and feel like there's more empathy in the relationship.

Why do I do this? There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing people ***reach their fullest potential***. It's a beautiful thing and I love trip sitting.

**Who I am on a microdose**

Microdosing is great because it's subtle enough that no one would notice except you. When I microdose I'm more amped about life, about the task at hand, and have a noticeable improvement in drive and motivation to get shit done. I've realized that I'm more creative; I have better ideas, and my ideas are more fluid and less traditional, I'm appreciably more witty, social, and more of a badass. This is all really subjective but after months of microdosing I am pretty certain I can distinguish the effects that are unique to LSD here. Though I'm typically very introverted and basically glued to my computer at home most of the day, on a microdose I can effortlessly decide to go out, check out events, or decide to do something social that otherwise would take a lot of mental energy.

It's important to know that even on a microdose, *you're still the captain of your own ship and are responsible for the outcome*. It's way easier to have a good time and work towards developing good habits on a microdose, but it's not quick fix where you pop an 1/8th tab and wait for magic to happen. It is merely a catalyst for great things, and microdosing every 3 days will help you build upon smaller successes.

The purpose of microdosing is to put your mind in a ""learning state"" that makes new habits more ""sticky"". And by consistently microdosing and practicing something the stickiness will build up and the habit will remain with you more strongly.

**Permanent Outcomes**

I would dare to say that the human being I am now is incredibly different than who I was 4 months ago when I started everything. I'm significantly more aware, more straightforward with people, daring, open, creative, and I definitely give no effs compared to before. I work and I do what I think I need to do without worrying about the outcome as much. I ***completely*** know who I am now, inside and out. I've come to terms with my weaknesses as a person, accepted them, and am learning how to work around them to get what I want. Other weaknesses I've gotten rid of completely. I know why I used to be avoidant, I know why I treated people certain way, and I know what I need to do to shatter my personal boundaries. I'm still a work in progress but the path is clear now, and I'm excited at the opportunity to challenge myself further.

**Eterneraki's Protocol for getting the best out of LSD & MDMA**

I think it's absolutely imperative to do both eventually. They are like yin and yang. LSD takes a scattered room and helps you gain insight from seemingly unrelated thoughts. MDMA makes you accept the things you've had difficulty accepting and makes you realize that things aren't nearly as big of a deal as you once thought. Just fucking go for it.

If you have anger or anxiety issues I recommend MDMA FIRST. Then a week or 2 later you can do LSD.

Prior to either MDMA or LSD take a week to do the following:

* Practice mindfulness meditation (headspace is a great app) for at least 10 minutes every day
* Take 5-10 minutes every night and write a journal entry. Personal reflections, examine your mood and start thinking about what you want to accomplish during your trip
* Start preparing a list of at least 5 questions you would want to ask yourself during the trip. Some questions may include ""What holds me back from X?"" ""Why is my relationship with this person X?"" ""what do I like about myself?"" ""Why am I afraid/worried/etc about X?"" The more specific the better, but general questions are better than no questions
* Clear out the ENTIRE day that you will be tripping. On the day of, silence your phone and get it out of the way. Your trip sitter should ask you the questions you've prepared right after your peak (~4 hours in).
* Journal the night after your trip as well as the next day or 2 afterwards

MDMA Protocol is 100mg (up to 120 if you're on the heavy side), then 60-75mg 2 hours after the first dose. This is basically the same as the MAPS therapy program. Trip will last 4-6 hours

* Mix the powder in a drink (powder is really bitter, juice is better than water). DO NOT CHUG IT or you will feel nauseous when it all hits you at once. Take sips here and there and finish it over a 3-5 minute span of time. Make sure you eat a light meal 2 hours before. Anything more will either delay onset or reduce effects.

LSD Protocol is 150mcg preferably in the morning (the earlier the better). Trip will last 6-8 hours and you will be tired as fuck. 

In both scenarios it's important to be with someone (SOBER) who cares about you.

AFTERWARDS - This is when the real work begins. Take your new insights and realizations and make a plan to practice being a better you. If you want to microdose take 12.5mcg every third day in the morning. You may do this for 10 weeks straight. Microdosing is safe and very few (if any) adverse events have been noticed by the vast majority of people. Continue reflecting, meditating, and documenting your progress. A support system is tremendously helpful.

**Where to buy - precursor vs actual drug**

/r/darknetmarkets

I personally buy from ""pushing taboo"" (look it up)

precursor lsd as far as I know is just as potent/useful. It's a little more expensive though so I prefer to just buy LSD straight up.

---

**Abuse**

Both can be abused but MDMA is significantly easier to abuse. Newbies can take MDMA again a few weeks after the first, but the recommendation is at least 6 weeks. If you've taken MDMA twice in 2 months, you should wait 3 months before your next roll. 4 times a year thereafter is optimal. Any more than that and you risk falling into the abyss (and it's not fun from what I heard).

LSD is so exhausting that you probably will never want to touch the stuff again, but some people still manage to abuse it. 1 full trip every 6 months is more than enough.

Don't be a fucking idiot.

---

**Safety**

[This graph is a good tl;dr](http://imgur.com/KV6TdKM) 
(Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs)

I'm pretty exhausted from writing all of this out but there are numerous studies on the safety profile of LSD, MDMA, and shrooms. They're completely safe when not abused. Be aware of potential drug interactions if you're on SSRIs or something else.
