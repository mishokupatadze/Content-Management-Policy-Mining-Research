When someone ask me to introduce myself, the first thing I can think of are some shitty side projects that look good on my resume, and nothing more. I'm a mindless, lifeless, hobbyless ECE drone. Everyday, all of my life revolves around MPs, exams, final projects, one after another in an never ending loop. On rare occasions when I have the luxury to eat with friends, all we can talk about are classes and internships. Otherwise, I only have time for some very late night vidya. What's the point of staying in school, if I'm only training myself to be a better slave? That six figure job mean nothing if all I'm gonna do is continuing to be a coding drone for eternity.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the people I meet and hangout with each semester solely depends on what classes I'm taking. If we end up taking different classes, then we might as well go to different schools.\\n\\nThe worst part is: If I even remotely try to allocate time for anything \\\"fun\\\", I get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. If I devote all of my time to studying, I still get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. I feel lost.\",\n",
