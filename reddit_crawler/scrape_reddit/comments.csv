I am a new instructor to UIUC this year.  But, I have been teaching nutrition for over 16 years at the college level.  I wanted to make myself available in case you had any questions prior to or after registering for summer or fall. 
 So, I am introducing myself as well as sharing a little about the class. Last semester I had well over 60% of the class work hard and earn an A and this semester the students are doing even better (they are a wonderful group). Let me know if you have any questions about the class...I am here for you!

Is the combo of 241 361 412 doable? I heard that 241 is hard but also there is someone saying it’s not that bad. And is there any recommendation for interesting gened? Appreciate any replies.

Some days you might hate yourself if you've fallen behind, but I recommend starting and finishing 225 MPs early, try to speedrun 213/214 hw, and if 391 MP is out work on that or study for 213/214 if you've been putting little time into those classes.

I took ECON 202 w Schultz online, and the two classes were basically the same.

The beginning of ECON 203 covers the same stuff as the end of ECON 202, so it might be better to take 202. But I never took stats, so I don't know what they covered. (Also, if you took Math 124, there's lots of overlap with ECON 202)"

With 225 instead of 385 and the addition of 313/Math 347, I would strongly advise against 314 lab, if not recommend you consider not taking one of your selected.

I took this class last year, and imo it's a wonderful class. Since u will be making a research paper, you will  need some regression knowledge from econ 203.  However, Professor Thornton is an excellent instructor so you don't need to worry about it. The empirical research paper part is the best thing about this class imo since you will be developing ur own topic and find ur own data. It's difficult, but it's fun and you learn tons from this because she is amazing imo. You will also learn some really useful skills with STATA as well.

Once you add in the fact that 210 and 286 meet 4 days a week, 210 has a lab every so often, etc, you will be very busy.  I wouldn't add anything purely because you'll already be in class for 15 hours on a good week, and 18 hours on a bad week.  That is just class time.

357,dw9mbqa,870r6c,jaykiwi,2018-03-25,4,I'm in 225 right now with Fagen and he's amazing. He really cares about his students 
358,dw9q7io,870r6c,ProjectTermina,2018-03-25,3,Wade is amazing. Probably one of the best instructors I've had because he taught concepts effectively and gave me motivation to come to class and get things done at a time when I was struggling to find it. He puts in a lot of effort to enable students to succeed. 
359,dw9rvs9,870r6c,Wlfgang,2018-03-25,3,"Yep! Wade (Fagen) is a really great guy who cares a lot about his students. If 225 is being run similar to last fall, you probably won't see Beckman much unless you take the extra honors component of the class, but he's good too. Don't know much about Herman because he only did one lecture of CS 233 this semester, he seems pretty good though."
360,dwwdqpf,870r6c,flava-armr,2018-04-06,1,"You are required to take IB 150 and MCB 150.

The IB 150 professor, Dr. Ben Clegg, is a really great lecturer but he is even better in office hours (they will change your life). Also his German accent is fun to listen to and he will randomly shout some stuff in lecture.

Brad Mehrtens is the MCB 150 instructor. To be honest, I did not like him just because of his personality and attitude towards biochemistry (my old major), but he is a really good lecturer. His office hours do not help, but the TAs are really fantastic.


I had transfer credit for CHEM 102/103, so I have no idea how those professors are. 

For CHEM 104, I have Dr. Christian Ray and HE IS FANTASTIC!! His lectures are fun, and he seems to really care about every student. Lol I had a melt down in 203 last semester and was crying outside of the chem annex. He saw me (didn’t even know me) and sat down and talked to me. He then walked me to the counseling center! He’s a really good guy and I had no idea that I would have him next semester. His office hours are crowded, but they really help as well as his weekly review sessions. Also, if he gets to know you, he might write you a smashing letter of recommendation (like he did for me)!!!"
361,dx3i48f,870r6c,cherryandlimelacroix,2018-04-09,2,"Yeah it's a large one, but you can get as much as help as you're willing to go to. There's weekly labs, office hours like 10 hrs a week, the professor and TAs are really nice and chill people who would accommodate if needed. Idk how many kids there are at office hours, but I'm sure you could get help if you needed. There's also plenty of help online, with stuff like Codeacademy "
362,dwhys3j,870r6c,mathuiuc,2018-03-29,2,"Spring 2019, I believe, though you can take his online Math 441 class through NetMath starting this summer."
363,dwa2fgn,870r6c,Chu-Chu76,2018-03-25,1,"yes if you don't mind, I think it will help a lot of people :). probably things like what textbooks are used, topics covered, course structure (hw? projects? test?), coding language used."
364,dx074cx,870r6c,BrilliantFig,2018-04-08,2,Ive taken CHEM 236 already 
365,dwagi7s,870r6c,glaba314,2018-03-25,1,"That should be manageable then. Personally, I found it to be a bit light when I took a very similar schedule freshman year, so if you think you can handle it, consider taking physics / chem as well."
366,dwagik0,870r6c,mksy345,2018-03-25,1,"Should be fine, just do you homework, and take a class for fun if u want."
367,dwfi5ok,870r6c,frenchfreakk,2018-03-28,1,"Imo yes.  Books you have to read with it and a few essays, Professor is great too and you can email or show her ideas/sections of ur essays and she’ll give you great feedback. No tests either. "

369,dwhfco5,870r6c,Wompper,2018-03-29,1,The school posts up their discussions on new plans especially new majors somewhere. I think the econ stat major would be coming within 3 years if I recall. 
370,dwgjkii,870r6c,tobydabest,2018-03-28,1,yeah 110 is an enforced prerequisite well 212 + 286 is just recommended
371,dwfnjgr,870r6c,threceow,2018-03-28,0,it's both 110 and 212. it's on course explorer. 212 is crucial for your understanding in the class.

376,dww1byi,870r6c,RG-Falcon,2018-04-05,3,i went to stat advising before and unger said you can get credit for 200 with 203.

378,dxadw0v,870r6c,ChemistryGirl12,2018-04-13,1,"Lol if you added CS 225, it would indeed become a near-impossible schedule "
379,dx6yywz,870r6c,econ20162,2018-04-11,1,I think you will be fine. The class would review some concepts of regression.
380,dx7zynj,870r6c,notapresident,2018-04-11,1,"I personally think so. If you wanna take it slow and get an easy A in Calc 1 that's okay too, Calc 2 is a lot of work on your own time, it's hard for most first semester freshmen."
381,dwe5udh,870r6c,VenSap,2018-03-27,2,I'd say roughly similar depending on your strengths. Personally 325 was easier than 225 but thats obv. different for everyone.

(Also, er, we still have the Summer 2 class set as Pending.) Unless you have financial aid for summer, which most people don't, the self-paced version is cheaper because you don't have to pay any extra fees.

Self-paced NetMath registration is done through netmath.illinois.edu. Put in a registration request and make sure to note you want to take the class in summer. Otherwise they'll assume you want to start as soon as your college gives approval for you to take the class. (Except 441 won't be available for registration until closer to summer.)"

However, I can definitely attest to the fact that my life revolves around ECE. Constantly worrying about classes, late nights, hours of homework, MP after MP - all this has definitely impacted my social life and communication skills.

I don't know if this helps, but I personally go pretty hard during the weekdays and get a lot of shit done then. That way, I at least have ONE day of the week to myself (Saturday). Sunday is kind of the beginning of the grind again + any finishing touches.

In general, I'm just saying that while ECE can be an insane burden, there's still some balance you can achieve.

554,dx9pjop,8btrg7,kellyfromthecity,2018-04-12,38,"I'm gonna say something that's gonna make you even sadder: it's EVEN harder to make friends as an adult in the real world with an adult job. At least when you're in college, you're surrounded by people pretty close to your age, all in the same stage of life. Once I graduated and got a job, it was so hard to make friends. My coworkers were all older than me, had kids, in a completely different stage of life, etc. 

My advice is: if you wanna find and make friends, you have to join an organization or find a hobby. It doesn't have to be an RSO and it doesn't have to be on campus. That is really the best way to make friends, because you'll be bonding over common interests. There's tons of different groups in the UIUC community as well as the greater Champaign Urbana community. Having hobbies is how I met most of my friends.

And you don't need a ton of friends. Quality over quantity. It takes time, be patient. And yes you'll have to be a little proactive in asking people to hangout. It will be awkward at first but either they'll say no and you move on, or they say yes and you make a friend.

581,dxadxxr,8btrg7,Shutu_Kihl,2018-04-13,1,"It's not a solution, but it's a form of consolation: take advantage of being lonesome. Of course, given that you're bogged down by engineering shit all the time, it seems, maybe it's hard for you to do. But, you don't have strings attached like being obligated to meet up with others. Do some activities that are solo, perhaps an art form like drawing or singing by yourself or running on campus by yourself. 

As well, take the time to spend on yourself and develop your character, if it hasn't changed. Try to think about why you perceive yourself awkward, and whether it is that makes people perceive you as awkward (if that is the case, and it's not just your false self-perception). Do you not relate to others and have a hard time staying in conversation with others? Are you too anxious to carry on a conversation? Do you just lack the confidence in yourself to act natural in front of others? I'd say face possible issues like these and deal with them, similar to someone with a phobia would do by straight-up experiencing them and getting used to them.

Also, as a practice you could settle on for now, take comfort in others' happiness. Maybe people like you or I aren't vibing out with others the way the happy campers on the quad today were, but I take solace in the fact that there *are* people being happy in this world. It's nice to see a smile, even if it's not mine. It's something you can strive for, and you'll probably eventually reach it, come time."

And yeah, if you complain to non ENG majors about ""how hard my life is"" they sometimes take it as an affront or don't understand your specific stress. Freshman year I felt like I had shallow friendships too, but all friendships do start out as shallow, honestly. It took me a year to feel like I had real friends, and even then sometimes we'd have issues and I'd get that same old feeling again: no real friends. I guess my point is... yes, keep trying to make friends, but... I don't think this is your fault. Maybe this doesn't improve your outlook, but this kind of awkward no-friends-currently happens all the time, including to me, and I'm real social. You aren't an awkward fuck. You're actually really eloquent. Don't blame this on yourself, unless you're like being mean to people. Try to take it for the unfortunate situation it is and not as a ""wow, there must be something wrong with me"".

Edit: if you run at all, xc and track clubs have a huge concentration of engineering students, and you go on nice runs and talk as much or little as you want, and everyone gets to know your face.

I used to be really embarrassed about doing things alone, so I would just stay inside all day playing video games. Eventually I realized that I prefer being alone to being in a group larger than 2-3 people. Idk about you, but I'm a huge introvert so it helped that I LITERALLY needed time to myself in order to function. Ig it just feels weird bc we're conditioned to think certain activities are social activities (i.e. eating food, taking a walk outside, sports, etc.) Obviously you need other people for frisbee so not everything is exactly solitary, but I'm a former figure skater doing soccer now, and my favorite thing about skating was that I could be alone. Aside from your coach, you were expected to be alone and not distract others. Soccer's kinda different, but people won't think anything other than ""oh they're just trying to become a better player!"" If they see you alone with a ball.

I guess what I'm saying is that you should condition yourself to do things alone. If you're really embarrassed of being alone, start with something that kind of requires you to be on your own. For me, that was figure skating. Some other activities could be machining or just taking walks or sitting in lounges on your own (just pretend like you're going somewhere or do something important LOL). Then you can slowly move on to doing more social activities on your own.

You didn't even ask for advice so sorry for giving it, but I hope you appreciate it! Btw when I see people eating alone I just think something along the lines of, ""girl ME TOO."" In the most positive way. :)"

In grad school I made tons of close friends so easily, but at UIUC in order to make friends, you have to naturally be one of those people who gets super involved in extracurriculars. I tried forcing myself to get involved in extracurriculars, but if it doesn't come naturally its kind of tough to go beyond the requirements to get to those leadership positions where you get to know people better.

649,dxbs4fw,8c2qs0,eeknim,2018-04-13,1,"Taking ECE 333 should be fine. There is not too much overlap between 333 and 210, and pre reqs are only ever enforced for a select few classes(such as 120 before 220, and certain CS classes)."
650,dxbsdsp,8c2qs0,lightsaebeler,2018-04-13,1,"You could take a non-ECE tech elective, such as MSE 280, MUS 407, etc.  There is a posted list of them, which tend to balance well with ECE tech electives."
651,dxbmrfy,8c2qs0,SidiqJ,2018-04-13,1,"No I haven’t taken 220, but I’m taken 120 in fall, and I was thinking ab 313 but I was told not to take it together with 210 and 120 especially for my first semester here"
652,dxbqkow,8c2qs0,SidiqJ,2018-04-13,1,I did and and they told me to take a tech elective but idk which one to take.
653,dxbqm49,8c2qs0,SidiqJ,2018-04-13,1,So shall I take two gen Ed’s instead? Maybe a humanity  and a non western?
654,dxbngvb,8c2qs0,Clers,2018-04-13,2,Correct dont do that.
