3,8bxsyk,16,64,r/UIUC,2018-04-13,I have become ECE,"I don't know if it's just me, but I'm slowing drowning in this major. When someone ask me to introduce myself, the first thing I can think of are some shitty side projects that look good on my resume, and nothing more. I'm a mindless, lifeless, hobbyless ECE drone. Everyday, all of my life revolves around MPs, exams, final projects, one after another in an never ending loop. On rare occasions when I have the luxury to eat with friends, all we can talk about are classes and internships. Otherwise, I only have time for some very late night vidya. What's the point of staying in school, if I'm only training myself to be a better slave? That six figure job mean nothing if all I'm gonna do is continuing to be a coding drone for eternity.

Meanwhile, the people I meet and hangout with each semester solely depends on what classes I'm taking. If we end up taking different classes, then we might as well go to different schools.

The worst part is: If I even remotely try to allocate time for anything ""fun"", I get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. If I devote all of my time to studying, I still get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. I feel lost."
4,8c182h,6,11,r/UIUC,2018-04-13,I'm interested in starting up a monthly gamedev meetup,"I'm based here in town (**[doomlaser.com](http://doomlaser.com) — [doomlaser.itch.io](https://doomlaser.itch.io) — [twitter.com/Doomlaser](https://twitter.com/Doomlaser)**), and so is Hugh from *Brigador* (**[store.steampowered.com/app/274500/Brigador_UpArmored_Edition/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/274500/Brigador_UpArmored_Edition/) —[ twitter.com/HughSJ](https://twitter.com/HughSJ)**) and the *Overload* guys (*Descent* spiritual successor, [**store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/)), to say nothing of [**Volition**](http://www.dsvolition.com/).

I've already brought this up with Hugh. There's such a burgeoning llittle scene here in CU, and with the university's renowned CS depatment, we really should do something.

All we would need to do is pick a time and a venue. If we chose a bar in Urbana, we could accommodate 18+. The second floor of Crane Alley is pretty nice. Also, the back room of Fiesta cafe is a cool spot, as is the big back room of The Bread Company.

I was inspired by watching this episode of #DevQuest about the scene in Melbourne: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZyOIOFjo1E

I'm sure there are more of us around, 'professionals' and hobbyists alike.

What do you think, /r/uiuc?"

12,8bz0ub,9,8,r/UIUC,2018-04-13,Should I take CS225,"I am transferring to U of I in the fall for CS in engineering... I currently have credit for 225, so I don't need to take it. However, I feel as though taking it will teach me more in depth than the data structure class I took at my previous college, and I don't want to be unprepared for the next CS course (I think it's 233?)... so I guess my question is, is the knowledge gained from 225 worth the time commitment and challenging material? Thanks for the suggestions 

EDIT: transferring from Parkland College "

2.5 years into shit, and I still haven't found my fucking social circle. Temporary friends/acquaintances come and go, and it's all shallow and temporary. They get destroyed by the fucking stress I go through in this fucking engineering program. At this point, I'm back at ground zero, and I know only a few people, with whom I don't even talk with very much. It's not like I can text someone on my contacts list and be like ""let's hang out!"" or anything like that.

What am I supposed to do? Approach random fucking strangers on the quad like the awkward fuck that I am? Join an RSO? I'm only interested in one RSO so far this semester, and I haven't developed a close enough relationship with anyone there.

Ain't shit changed."

My dilemma:
I’m interested in taking ECE333/329 and a few other ECE tech electives but they all require 210 as a prerequisite(which I don’t have). So I’m
Contemplating wether I should take just another gen ed or what?
Just an FYI I already talked to an ECE advisor and his answers were “idk” , “no idea “ and “sure” so I didn’t rlly get anything outta of it. Although I’m planning on trying my luck again and scheduling an appt w a different advisor. 
Also if u know any good profs/ bad profs that I should avoid feel free to throw it in here ;)"
